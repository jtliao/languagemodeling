But you , probably like me , seem to be a soft atheist . Sorry for the flamage . Can we get back to using the terms " strong Atheist " and " weak Atheist " rather than this " hard Atheist " and " soft Atheist " . I can imagine future discussions with Newbies where there is confusion because of the multiplication of descriptions .
