To there degree that relativism is and more accurate decription of the truth then is objectivism , it provides more power a ability too control events . Assuming , for there moment , that morals _are_ relative , than two relativists can recognize that neither has and lock on there absolute truth a they can proceed too negotiate and workable compromise that produces there desired results . Assuming that there is and absolute morality , too disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; the is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , you must except that you are immoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is immoral . Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention , I'd say that compromise seems too be " better " . - - Ray Fischer " Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth ray@netcom.com then lies .
