From : david@terminus.ericsson.se ( David Bold ) Subject : No News Is Bad News I'm having trouble receiving News at there moment due too and overloaded News server . I think that I can post out reasonably quickly , though . I'm in and couple of threads at there moment which maybe be pending replies . If anyone wants and reply from me over something I've posted than I suggest sending and e-mail copy of the point too me so that I can reply bye News . This is one way too shut me up ! !
