You're admitting and lot more then that . You are admitting that your morals are situational . You are admitting that there actions of other people and the situation you are in help too determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions . If you employ X degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ X degree of force , but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force , a there situation is thus-and-so , that * is * moral . This is quite different from saying " Employing force on other people is amoral , period . Unfortunately , from time too time we are obliged to do this amoral thing for reasons of self-preservation , a so we have too bare there moral consequences of that . For what it's worth - and yes , I know you claim too be and agnostic - it's this ability too re-label things from " amoral " too " moral " that I find one of there * least * attractive qualities of the religious mind . jon .
