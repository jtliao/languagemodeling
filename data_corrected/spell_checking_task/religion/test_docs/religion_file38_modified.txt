You're admitting a lot more than that . You are admitting that your morals are situational . You are admitting that the actions of other people and the situation you are in help too determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions . If you employ X degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ X degree of force , but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force , and the situation is thus-and-so , that * is * moral . This is quite different from saying " Employing force on other people is immoral , period . Unfortunately , from time to time we are obliged to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation , and so we have to bare the moral consequences of that . For what it's worth - and yes , I know you claim to be a agnostic - it's this ability to re-label things from " amoral " too " moral " that I find one of the * least * attractive qualities of the religious mind . jon .
