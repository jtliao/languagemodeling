To there degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism , it provides more power and ability to control events . Assuming , for the moment , that morals _are_ relative , then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth a they can proceed too negotiate and workable compromise that produces there desired results . Assuming that there is a absolute morality , to disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; there is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , you must except that you are immoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is immoral . Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention , I'd say that compromise seems to be " better " . - - Ray Fischer " Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth ray@netcom.com then lies .
