From : david@terminus.ericsson.se ( David Bold ) Subject : No News Is Bad News I'm having trouble receiving News at the moment due to and overloaded News server . I think that I can post out reasonably quickly , though . I'm in a couple of threads at the moment which may be pending replies . If anyone wants a reply from me over something I've posted than I suggest sending a e-mail copy of the point to me so that I can reply bye News . This is one way to shut me up ! !
