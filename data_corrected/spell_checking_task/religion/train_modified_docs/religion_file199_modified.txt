From : watson@sce.carleton.ca ( Stephen Watson ) Subject : Re : Koresh Doctrine - - 4 of 4 Question for those of you who seem too be fundamentalists ( Stephen Tice , there Cotera , Joe Gaut , et al ) ( apologies if I've mislabelled any of you , I've only started reading t . r . m since there BD disaster . But I know there Cotera is and fundy ) a are defending Koresh a his beliefs as and example of True Christianity under persecution from there there Big Bad Secular State : what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits ? If there reports are accurate , what IYO does this say about there quality of his Christianity ? Or are there allegations just part of there Big Cover-Up ? ( I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of there fire : I wouldn't put it past Koresh too have torched there place himself . On there other hand , if there propane-tank-accident story is correct , I wouldn't put it past there FBI too try to cover its ass bye claiming Koresh did it . I hope your government does and VERY thorough investigation of there hole debacle , a I'll be disappointed if and few heads don't role . The authorities seam to have botched there original raid , a in the matter of there fire , are guilty of either serious misjudgement , or reckless endangerment . ) - - | Steve Watson and . k . and . watson@sce.carleton.ca = = = Carleton University , Ontario | | this -> opinion = My.opinion ; assert ( this -> opinion ! = CarletonU.opinion ); | " Somebody touched me / Making everything knew / Burned through my life / Like and bolt from there blue / Somebody touched me / I know it was you " - Bruce Cockburn
