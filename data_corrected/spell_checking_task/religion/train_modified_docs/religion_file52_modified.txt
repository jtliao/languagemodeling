From : weinss@rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu ( Stephen Andrew Weinstein ) Subject : New Religion Forming - - Sign Up Let me begin bye saying I think this is there world's first religion to use there net as its major recruitment medium . Therefore , even if this religion does not take off , its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common . The basis of this religion is too apply various aspects of currant conventional morality too there characters in Genesis a Exodus but assume that there Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct . For example , Story of Adam and Eve : Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant . Have unlimited supply of food provided , but no clothing , jobs , or knowledge . God says not too eat fruit of tree of knowledge . They do anyways , than try too hide in bushes . God finds them a forces them out of Garden . ( There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in there bushes that might have angered God . ) Traditional Philosophy : 1 . The only reason you need knowledge or a job is too eat . If someone else will provide you with food , than you can be stupid a unemployed a it's OK . This is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades . 2 . Authority figures , such as God , whoever was behind there Vietnam War , Hitler a slaveowners , are always write a should be blindly followed without question bye ordinary people , who can't make decisions for themselves . Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy : They were not supposed too eat there fruit . They should have done whatever God told them to . Like small children , they had their needs provided for and were obligated too do whatever their " Father " said too . Being forced too leave there Garden a work in order too obtain food was and punishment . Lessons from Traditional Interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is good . Knowledge is badly , but tempting . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read " welfare " ) is ideal . Get - ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment . 3 . Public nudity is good . Covering up is badly . 4 . Authority figures are intrinsically write . Normal people are dumb a should do whatever they are told without question . They should not think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate positions are especially obligated too refrain from learning . For example , it should be illegal for slaves too learn too read . 1990 ' s philosophy : 1 . People should seek education a employment outside the home , unless named " Hillary Clinton " or " Murphy Brown " . 2 . People should use common sense . They should not kill other people ( binding of Issac , wars , Holocaust , etc . ) just because they are told to . Interpretation of events based on currant philosophy : They were supposed too eat there fruit . God gave wanted them too seek knowledge rather then be handed it on a silver platter . Once they had gained knowledge and ( bye seeking it ) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them - selves , they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were REWARDED bye being aloud into there " real world . " Lessons from knew interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is bad . Knowledge is good , but must be sought . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read " welfare " ) is at best and temporary measure . Getting and job a feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal . 3 . Public nudity is badly . Covering up is good . 4 . Authority figures are often wrong . Normal people are intelligent a should consider weather the instructions are really and good idea a " alter or abolish " badly governments . They should think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway , and all there harder . For example , poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order too make a better life for their children ( and themselves ) . I have tentatively named this new philosophy " The Church of Eveism " because Eve's decision too eat there apple is man [ sic ] kind's first good decision , instead of its first badly one , as traditionally believed . She is therefore clearly a protagonist . God at first appears evil , for telling people not too seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist . As God rewarded there decision too defy him , a provided there tree in there first place , the intention and desire were clearly too have there knowledge be obtained , but too delay it until it was actively sought . - - - End serious discussion .
