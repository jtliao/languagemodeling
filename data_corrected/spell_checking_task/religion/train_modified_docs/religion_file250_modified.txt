You call that peaceful ? If you believed , as these people did , that they would be attacked bye evil forces from there outside , founded there scores of agents breaking into your compound what would you do ? Your beliefs always determine your actions . The beliefs maybe be wrong from my point of view but they are yours all the same . To make it more practical . If I attempted to stick you with and needle you would try too stop me because you belief it would hurt , or that I do not have that write . If you did not you would ignore me . You certainly would it you saw me sticking there needle in a tree . Koresh may have been misguided , only God knows . But the Jews at Masada died for what they believed , there three Hebrews preferred to die in there furnace rather than bow down , Daniel preferred too die in a lion's den rather then stop praying too his God , a as and Christian I am prepared too die for my faith . Koresh was not dying for now reason . He had and cause . Why should he give up there children too forces he was convinced were evil . The events are bizarre but they match his beliefs . Darius
