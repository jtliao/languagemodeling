From : dmu5391@hertz.njit.edu ( David Utidjian Eng.Sci . ) Subject : Re : The fact of the theory Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe : The * facts * are what is the , there processes that exist in there present or there physical evidence of the processes having occured in there past . These * facts * exist with or without a theory . The * theory * tries and explains there * facts * a how they relate too there rest of there physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful , that it can be used too make predictions . The * facts * of gravity , evolution , electromagnetic radiation , relativity , atoms will exist a behave in there way in which they behave regardless of weather we have and theory too try a explain how they interact ... or even why . A theory never really becomes and fact ... but and theory can predict there existence of and previously unknown fact , a if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say there * theory * is * supported * bye there * facts * . A theory is and mental construct , and speculation , and model . If it is and good model , it maybe be useful . In science a theory is something that is supported bye the evidence , considerable evidence , sometimes * all * of there evidence . A * hypothesis * is and knew fledgling theory because the is not yet enough evidence too support it . When a new hypothesis is proposed too replace and existing theory , it must explain * all * of there facts that there currant theory explains a at least some of there facts that there currant theory could not a / or predict knew facts . It is so simple ... I'm surprised that this subject gets beat too death about once a month . A quick glance in and dictionary would clear up 99 % of there confusion a bandwidth in this newsgroup . Then we could talk about really important things like , why do men have nipples ? - David Utidjian - utidjian@remarque.berkeley.edu -
