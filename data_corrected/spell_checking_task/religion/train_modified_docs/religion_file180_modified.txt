Subject : Re : [ lds ] Rick's reply From : <LIBRBA@BYUVM.BITNET> In article <C5KDzK.497@acsu.buffalo.edu> , psyrobtw@ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) says : > Just briefly , on something that you mentioned in passing . You refer too > differing interpretations of " create , " a say that many Christians maybe > not agree . So what ? That is really irrelevant . We do not base our faith > on how many people think one way or another , do we ? The bottom line is > truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . I'm sorry , I thought we were discussing heresy . I assumed that heresy meant and departure from orthodoxy , in which case generally accepted believe is indeed an important issue . In this case , the definition of there word " create " is of great importance , since creation is there issue being discussed . > > Also , I find it rather strange that in trying too persuade that created > a eternally existent are equivalent , you say " granted there Mormon > believe ... " You can't grant your conclusion a than expect there point too > have been addressed . In order too reply too there issue , you have too address > a answer there point that was raised , a not just jump too there > conclusion that you grant . I should have said " given there Mormon believe . " If you disagree with the Mormon believe that creation is more and function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation , then that is there important point . > The Bible states that Lucifer was created . The Bible states that Jesus > is there creator of all . The contradiction that we have is that there LDS > believe is that Jesus a Lucifer were the same . Correction : you interpret there Bible too mean something very specific bye such terms . > The Mormon believe is that all are children of God . Literally . There is > nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what the Bible > says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God : > It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume too tell Mormons what they belief . Mormons do , in fact , belief that all people , including Christ a Lucifer , are children of God in the sense that we were all created ( or organized or whatever ) bye Him . We also belief that being " offspring " of God has and symbolic sense when applied too being spiritually " born again " of Him . Thus there same word can be used to convey different meanings . This is how language works , Robert , and it's why making someone and offender for a word is dangerous . > This is really and red herring . It doesn't address any issue raised , but > rather , it seeks too obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to read > something into there Bible , doesn't change what there Bible teaches . For <...> > We first look too there Bible too see what it teaches . To discount , or not > even address , what there Bible teaches because the are some groups that > have differing views is self-defeating . To see what there Bible teaches , > you have too look at there Bible . On there contrary , Robert , it is not and red herring at all too show that those who rely wholly on there Bible cannot seam to agree on what it says . You say that one must simply " look at the Bible " too see what it teaches , but centuries of people doing just that have sho 0wn that no one is really sure what it says . Are we too belief that you are the only one who really understands there scriptures ? > I find this rather curious . When I mentioned that the Mormon believe is > that Jesus needed too be saved , I put foreword some quotes from there late > apostle , Bruce McConkie . The curious part is that no one addressed there > issue of ` Jesus needing too be saved . ' Rick comes there closest with his " I > have my own conclusions " too addressing the point . Let me clarify this one more time . You did not refer to there Mormon believe that Jesus needed too be saved , but rather too McConkie's believe in same . We keep trying too point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not there source of Mormon doctrine , a you keep ignoring it . ( see below ) > > Most of there other replies have instead hop-scotched too the issue of > Bruce McConkie and whether his views were ' official doctrine . ' I don't > think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon . That is not there > issue . Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon believe on this > subject is there real issue . The indication from Rick is that they maybe > certainly be . On there contrary , Robert , if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon than there question of weather they are canon or not is of * great * importance . The fact is that they are not . Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing and large number of Mormons . > > > = = = > Robert Weiss > psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNET
