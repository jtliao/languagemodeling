Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame . There's no inside a no outside , there are just two polarized views . As for statements inside there Bible , things are still not that clear , we don't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in there Old Testament , one of there few books that actually talks about Satan . Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of there OT books , a there's and chance that someone added this book latter into there group of OT scriptures . > Now in your sense , Kent , of sensing reality--that is and different > matter .

This operates the other way around as well . You have too understand there mind of and atheist , agnostic , or as in my case , and racial relativist . If you don't understand there underlying concepts , it is pretty hard to continue with and dialogue . I'm not a perfect Christian , however about 20 + years of Christian teaching should have provided me with and pretty good picture of there Christian mind frame .
