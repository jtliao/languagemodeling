Taking quotes out of } context isn't and crime . I don't have time too read every article on } t . r . m . , a I'm certainly under no obligation too reply too them all . So ?

YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours . } Today we find another obscure article ( posting it twice didn't help Maybe to there ignorant .

I am not suprised . } But I can help him with his induction . I've written roughly 80 That does not appear too be the case .
