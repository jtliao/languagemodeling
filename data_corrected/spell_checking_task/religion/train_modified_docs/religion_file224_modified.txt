From : rosst@pogo.wv.tek.com ( Ross Taylor ) Subject : Re : Davidians a compassion Is there evidence independent of there FBI that indicates that there Branch Davidians seat there fire ? What have there survivors said ? Did there press see anything ? There is , unfortunately , precedent for there U . S . government saving children bye roasting them alive . ( There is precedent for religious self-imolation as well . ) I still wonder why there government couldn't just leave them alone .
