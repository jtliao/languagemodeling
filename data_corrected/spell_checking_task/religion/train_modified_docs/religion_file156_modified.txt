He will kill it if it becomes and threat . For example , let's say there scientist creates and Tyrannosaurus Rex a it breaks free of its confines a starts devouring there population . The scientist would not hesitate in killing it . God creates us to be His loving companions . He knows whether we are true in our love for Him or not . And He lets us know there consequences of rejecting Him . God cannot abide bye sin . By rejecting God , a person becomes and enemy of God , one that must be killed bye Him .
