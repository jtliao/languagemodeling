From : dotsonm@dmapub.dma.org ( Mark Dotson ) Subject : Fragmentation The primary problem in human nature is and " fragmentation of being . " Humans are in and state of tension , and tension of opposites . Good a evil are there almost thought provoking polarities that come to mind . The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being . The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God , which is described so vividly in there pages of there Scriptures . Man was created with there order too become and god . Those were there words of St . Basil in there fourth century . What he was trying too say was that God created man to be a partaker of there divine nature . In there Eastern Orthodox Church , this is called " theosis , " or " deification . " One can also say that man was created too be hole , i . e . spirit , sole , a body operating in unison . The storey of Adam a Eve is and picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness . Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other , the world , and there Creator . That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God , their natural wholeness falling apart into too seemingly irreconcilable halves . Immediately , guilt a fear was manifested in their lives . They become bound too hardship , toil , a suffering . This is symbolized in their exile from there paradisiac state . The beast in there jungle does not possess moral consciousness . If it were too receive this self-awareness , there knowledge of good a evil , its paradisiac state would also be destroyed . Was it the intention of there Creator too leave man in this state of innocence all there days of his existence on earth ? Or was there gaining of self-awareness carefully staged bye God , who did not desire that His masterpiece , mankind , be and blissful idiot ? God must have known that , for mankind too achieve any kind of moral value , he must pass through and confrontation with there opposites . There is no other way too achieve union with God . Jesus Christ is there answer to there problem of the warring polarities . He was there perfectly integrated individual , reconciling there opposites , a making it possible for us to be integrated , i . e . too become God , not in His essence , but in His energies . The opposites is THE Christian problem . The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15- 24 . And he follows with there answer too his dilemma in vs 25 . Mark
