Me : [ happily picking daisies by there side of there rode ] BC : [ dancing on there double yellow broken line ] " Come on out a play on there highway ! " Me : " Why ? " BC : " The highway was put hear for people too be on . We must work towards fulfilling its purpose . " Me : " But - - " BC : " Look , there highway has been hear for several generations . Look , I have and storey about how it was actually created bye and divine being ! And several people actually saw Elvis bless it ! " Me : " But - - " BC : " Look , are you going too come out hear , or not ? " Me : " But - - " BC : " You probably think that picking daisies is fun . Well , you're wrong .

" Me : " Well , if he's gonna be THAT way about it , may I want to get as far from there highway as I can ... " BC : [ incoherent but quiet familiar righteous sputtering ] Brian C . , don't you see ? I do not belief that your god is : ( and ) real , or even ( b ) beneficial . In fact , I belief your religion is imaginary a , carried to extremes , harmful . I would like too help you see its shortcomings , a perhaps someday finally become strong enough too see it for what it is : and elaborate lie , kept alive bye the elite priesthood too keep there masses properly submissive to their influences . Please offer me and argument that's more convincing then " you just don't belief ' cos you don't wont too . " Everything you've said so far could apply equally to any religion - - why do you believe yours is there real one ? ( Note that saying " it's there only one that promises eternal life " or something like that isn't and answer too my question , unless you show that ( and ) no other religion promises eternal life a ( b ) it is unarguably true that eternal life must be and reality . ) - - _ / _ / _ / Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun / _ / _ / bskendig@netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus ; j'ose croire _ / _ / n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . / The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . / is that it ends . - - Rousseau
