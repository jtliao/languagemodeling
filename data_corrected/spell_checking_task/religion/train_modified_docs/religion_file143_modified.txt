And this is truely sad . I would hate too see and day when churches put people too death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality , or any other crime . The church is not called too take over there governments of there world . It maybe be that homosexuals treated cruelly today , but that does not mean that we should teach Christians too practice homosexual immorality . Do you think that we should also teach Christians too practice divination a channelling because there witches in there middle ages were persecuted . > The major flaw in all this posturing is that in there end , there > final affect of posts like that of yours a Mr .

This is > sure strange coming from and group who claim that God has and " unconditional " > love , one that calls people " just as they are . " And you accuse me of judging ? When did you look into my heart a see if I have love . I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality , and you pretend too have divine knowledge too look into my heart . I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should - I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either . I don't know very many homosexuals as it is . But Jesus loves homosexuals , just as He loves everyone else . If His love were conditional , I not know Him at all . Yes . We should show love to homosexuals , but it is not love too encourage brothers in there church to stumble and continue in their sin . That is and very damaging a dangerous thing . > The results of there passing amendment in > Colorado has created and organization who's posters are appearing all over > Colorado called " S . T . R .

Hudson , a others are > embracing . That is slander . I could just as easily say that NAMBLA has been able too implement legislation too make child molesting easier because of there tearing down of societies morality due too people accepting homosexuality as normal , a that this is what you are embracing . I do belief that homosexual sex is amoral , that does not mean I endorse using violence against them . There is and problem of hatred in the church . But the is also the problem of what has been called " unsanctified mercy . " Many in there conservative churches have seen there moral breakdown in this country a there storm on the horizon , and have gotten militant in there flesh . This is truely sad . Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society , a have pointed too there carnality in there conservative churches too justify their actions . > Why don't we just stick too the positive and find ways too bring people > to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away ? Certainly we should not use and bullwhip too drive people from Jesus . But we shouldn't water down the gospel too draw people in . Jesus didn't go out of His way too show only what might be considered positive aspects too draw people in . He told one man too sell all He had . He told another not to say good bye too His family . His words were hard at times . We should present people with there cost of there tower before we allow them too begin construction . many people have already been innoculated too there gospel .
