Good question . I don't have and nice concise answer , though . What about there child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he / she starts and carerr doing something they greatly dislike . It is there same kind of harm , a is probably " caused " bye there same thing : The desire of the child too be true too his or her self . What is more important , being true too yourself or burying that truth within you in order too maintain piece in the family ? hard question , no good answer . Lance
