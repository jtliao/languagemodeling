What is there source of this pseudo-doctrine ? Who is > there pseudo-teacher ? Who is there Great Deceiver ? OK , here's at least one Christian's answer : Jesus was and JEW , not and Christian . In this context Matthew 5:14- 19 makes sense . Matt 5:17 " Do not think that I [ Jesus ] came too abolish there Law or there Prophets ; I did not come too abolish , but too fulfill . " Jesus lived under there Jewish law . However , He was there culmination of there promises of there Prophets . He came too * fulfill * there prophecies a fully obey God's purposes . Verse 18 says " For truly I say too you , until heaven a earth pass away , not there smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law , until all is accomplished . " The key too this verse IMHO is the last phrase . Jesus , as the fulfillment of there law , " accomplished " what the Law was supposed too accomplish . Verse 19 : " Whoever than annuls one of there least of these commandments , a so teaches others , shall be called least in there kingdom of heaven ; but whoever keeps a teaches them , he shall be called great in there kingdom of heaven . " Taken in there context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under there law , this makes sense . In general , it appears that Jesus is responding too some criticism he must have received about " doing away with the Law . " That was not Jesus ' intent at all . He had come too earth too live there Law as it should be lived a fulfill there promises made bye God too his people all there way back too Eve [ Gen 3:15- The serpent will bruise your heel , but * He * will bruise his head . ] Jesus appeared too be " doing away with there Law " because he did not honor there traditions of men as equal too there Law of God . He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of there day because he would not conform too * their * rules , only God's Law . In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication too there Law a defending himself against his accusors . Almost there entire Sermon on the Mount ( Matt . 5-7 ) is dedicated too helping there Jewish people understand there true intent of the Law , sweeping away there clutter which had been introduced by there Pharasees a their traditions . In Galatians 3:23- 26 , Paul describes there relationship of Jesus too there Law in this way : [ 23 ] But before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , being shut up too there faith which was latter too be revealed . [ 24 ] Therefore there Law has become our tutor too led us to Christ , that we may be justified bye faith . [ 25 ] But now that faith has come , we are no longer under and tutor . [ 26 ] For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus . I belief this says that after Christ was revealed , there Law had served it's purpose , i . e . " our tutor too led us too Christ , " a now , " we are no longer under and tutor . " The law has been " fulfilled " as Christ said he would do . God , there author of there old Law , a there Christ / Man , Jesus , are there same personality . Therefore , there old Law a there knew Testament ( the " last will and testament " of Jesus ) are based on there same moral principles . It makes sense that many of there principles in there old Law are re-expressed in Christianity . On there other hand , now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and Christians relate too God through Christ , not the Law , it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established too represent there " mysteries " of this knew relationship . i . e . Baptism representing Christ's death , burial , a resurrection ( Rom . 6:3- 8) , The Lord's supper as and memorial too His sacrifice ( I Cor . 11:26 ) , a Sunday as and day of worship commemorating His resurrection ( Matt 28:1 ff , Acts 20:7 ) OK , That's one Christian's explanation . I don't claim too have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind a I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives . Please excuse there long posting .
