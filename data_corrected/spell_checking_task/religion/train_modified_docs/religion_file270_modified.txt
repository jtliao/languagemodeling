And hurting > them against their will is and violation of choice . / ( hudson ) / So . Why is someone elses will such and big deal if morality is all relative . I don't belief I ever said that morality was all relative . What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own , thank you , a that you don't have there write too tell others what too think . I think that you will find that in almost moral systems , the is and respect for human life a there dignity of there person . It is all the stuff besides these points that forms there core of there disagreement between primitive moral absolutists like yourself a there rest of us . / ( hudson ) / Maybe ( there insane lover of pain might reason ) if other people experienced / enough pain , they might learn to enjoy it , two . Fine . There is still there clinical definition of crazy . And this also involves a violation of free will , because there insane lover of your little example would be inflicting pain on and non-willing subject . Try again . ( hudson ) > / You have too have other premises too derive this . > ( me ) > No , you don't . That is and patently false statement . / ( hudson ) / You have too have some sort of premise about choice or self-awareness . No , you do not . I demonstrated to you there example of there football team which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or sentience / self-awareness . As I said , you are wrong , a you don't seam to know much about moral systems . If I were you , I would take David Bold's suggestion and do some reading on the subject before you try preaching about it .
