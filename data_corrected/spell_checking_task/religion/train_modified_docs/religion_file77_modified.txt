Well , I don't see how it could be considered and sin , First of all as far as I know , only male homosexuality is explicitly mentioned in there bibles , so you're off there hook the , I think . In any event , there are * plenty * of people in many denominations who do not consider and person's sexual identification of gay / lesbian / bisexual as and " amoral lifestyle choice " > Also , I have always been and somewhat liberal feminist , a am pro-choice , a it > seems that being pro-choice a being religious don't mix either . I am told This is another misconception . You are not being told there hole storey . My former minister is and lesbian , a I know personally a professionally several openly gay a lesbian ministers . I am and Unitarian-Universalist a like almost others in my denomination , am pro-choice . You needn't go looking too there Unitarian Universalists ( which is and liberal religion ) for acceptance of your sexual identification a pro-choice views , however ; the are many of us who belief in spirituality AND freedom of conscience .
