Because you are not being consistent . Moral systems must be consistent . A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others , but doesn't wont it inflicted upon themselves , has and double standard . And double standards are and violation of * any * moral system .

Are brussel / sprouts amoral ? Pain isn't amoral , stupid . Pain itself is just a physiological reaction . What > > is < < immoral is subjecting unwilling individuals to pain .

Sorry ; your cute > little analogy didn't survive for very long under scrutiny . / ( hudson ) / Why would it be wrong too make humans undergo there effects of there reactions / if humans are composed only of matter ? What humans are composed of isn't there qualifying criterion of weather or not something would be wrong . / ( hudson ) / Is it wrong too make matter undergo chemical reactions ? Yes , if it is sentient matter . / ( me ) / > Nature is not a sentient force ; there is no choice involved . Therefore , / > no question of morality . / ( hudson ) / I actually heard and geologist entertain there notion that matter had and will . / There is some sentient force out the . Fine . I have also herd that there government is encoding there DNA for and knew race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water . What's your point ? / ( hudson ) / If humans are made only of matter , than choices are also chemical reactions , / so why is choice and important issue . And if that is there case , than god is only and idea contained in the minds of people ( formed of matter ) and on printed pages ( also formed of matter ) and does not really exist . I can do there argumentem ad absurdium just as well as you can , but it won't prove any points for you or me . Got anything relevant you wont too talk about , or are you just playing cute little games ?
