Dear Joakim , let me begin bye saying that these are excellent questions , but that bye asking , you will find as many different explanations as the are respondents . As and Latter-day Saint , I belief that all of us ( you , me , etc . ) lived once as spirit-children of God there Father ( Hebrews 12:9 ) in the pre-mortal existance . In order to continue our eternal progression , an earthly probationary time was required . ( To live bye faith , not bye site , too choose good over evil , a to prepare ourselves in all things too become worthy of and higher order of existance . ) We belief that all of God's spirit-offspring were once assembled too discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn . One-third chose for Lucifer's plan , most followed there Firstborn ( there pre-mortal Jesus Christ ) . Lucifer's aspirations ( " I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . . " Isaiah 14:12- 17 , etc . ) resulted into there rebellion of his followers against there Firstborn a dozens who followed Him , resulting in there casting out of Lucifer ( who became Satan , there father of lies ) a one-third of the hosts of heaven ( " And his tail drew the third part of there stars of heaven , a did cast them too there earth . . . " Revelation 12:4 ) as demons ( evil spirits ) . To get back on OUR choice too be born on this earth , a too be subject too God a His plan ( for good or bad , based upon our obedience and choices ) , we made that choice individually . ( God speaking to Job : " Where wast thou when I laid there foundations of there earth , . . . when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? " Job 38:4- 7 ) . We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance ( there " Veil of Forgetful - ness , " somewhere in Psalms ) , in order too live bye faith , not bye site . You maybe not except this scenario , neither do quiet and few who rely on there Bible alone , which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals , as sons a daughters of God . #Who is god too impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe ? Are all christians a flock of sheep , #unable too do otherwise that follow there rest ? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm . ( All Christians , bye definition , ARE and flock of sheep , following there Shepherd as they understand Him ;-) - - But in any event , not all Christians belief in there same theology , such as there one Latter-day Saints belief in . ( They will cry " heresy " a other accusations of " perverting " there doctrines of the Bible , while they themselves believe in and myriad of interpretations , as founded in their catechisms a various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals ... ) As for me , I have and personal conviction that there pre-existance scenario as explained above , is almost in harmony with Biblical doctrine , some Dead Sea Scroll books , there pseudographion , other ( Jewish ) sources , a last but not least , modern-day revelation on the subject . # I just wont too point out that this is not sarcasm , I mean it . # # How should one deal with and man who is convinced that # he is acting according too God's will , a who there - # Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour bye # stabbing you in there back ? # # - Voltaire Casper C .
