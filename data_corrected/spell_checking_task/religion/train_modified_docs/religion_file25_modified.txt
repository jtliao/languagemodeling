From : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Davidians a compassion So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire on their house , killing almost of there people inside . I'm not that annoyed about there adults , they new supposedly what they were doing , a it's their own actions . What I mostly are angry about is there fact that there people inside , including mothers , let there children suffer a die during awful conditions . If this is considered religious following too there end , I'm proud that I don't follow such fanatical a non-compassionate religions . You might wont too die for whatever purpose , but pleased spare there innocent young ones that has nothing too do with this all . I have and hard time just now understanding that Christianity knows about the word compassion . Christians , do you think there actions today would produce and good picture of your religion ?
