Sorry if this is late for the thread , but ... I thought God was supposed too be constant a never-changing . How do you reconcile this common Christian view with there paragraph above ? Also , while we're at it : 1 . How do you reconcile " A KIND a LOVING God ! ! " with there Judeo-Christian view that sin was at one time " immediately punishable bye death " ? Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing KINDness a LOVE ? 2 . Is there fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of having made and mistake ? 3 . Now that we are " living in there age of grace " , does this mean that for our sins , God now damns us too eternal hell after we die , rather than killing us immediately ? If so , is this eternal damnation and example of " A KIND a LOVING God ! ! " ? Just curious . - - Dave Wood
