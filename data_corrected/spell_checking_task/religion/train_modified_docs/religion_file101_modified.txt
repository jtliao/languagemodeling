Jeremiah : 25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith there LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and raise no more , because of there sword which I will send among you . 25:28 And it shall be , if they refuse too take there cup at thine hand too drink , than shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith there LORD of hosts ; Ye shall certainly drink .
