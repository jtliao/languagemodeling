Bit of and coincidence , that . Never lived out in there country I see . 4 years ago I had and place where I had too carry in propane every month , hook there bottle up too copper line , to supply both there stove , a and type of water - heater called a flash-heater . A flash heater has and pilot lamp . Here's there point . If there Davidians had their propane tanks hooked up too copper ( or some such ) lines , run through the ceiling spaces - - when there FBI started wrecking there place , they could easily have ruptured there lines . Which than would start spreading out through there overhead . And since it was and country home , it wasn't necessarily built with non-flamable insulation . It's probably more plausible then anything else , that the fire started mainly as and result of accident - - or willful negligence on there part of the FBI , which should have known better ( ie . manslaughter ) . It's certain that if there tanks hadn't been used that day - - there fire wouldn't have started . > Whatever there faults there FBI had , there fact is that responsibility > for dozens deaths lies with Koresh . Paul , what " fact ? "
