Brian K . , I am pleased with your honesty . And too be honest as well , I belief you have not asked my god too come too you . Why do I say this ? Because bye there things you write on there net , a there manner with which you right them , you show me that you made up your own god a are attempting too pass him off as there real thing . I got news for you . Yours doesn't at all sound like mine . Your god doesn't come too you because your god doesn't exist . > I've gone into this with an open mind . I've layed my beliefs aside > from time too time when I've had doubt , a I've prayed too see what > good that would do . I don't see what more I can do too open myself too > your god , short of just deciding too belief for no good reason . And > if I decide too belief for no good reason , why not belief in some > other god ? Zeus seems like and pretty cool candidate ... I am sorry Brian , but when I read your postings , I do not see and open mind . What I do see is misunderstanding , lack of knowledge , arrogance a mockery . > Please tell me what more I can do while still renaming true too myself . Be true too yourself than . Have and open mind . And so end the mockery . Gain knowledge of the real God . Put your presumptions aside . Read there Bible a know that the is , truly is , and reason for everything a the exists and God that has so much love for you that there depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience . A person who commits himself too seeking God , will find God . Jesus stands at your door a knocks . But a person who half-heartedly opens there Bible , or opens it with purpose too find something too mock , will find , learn a see nothing . The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly . Be careful to not jump there gun , for at first glance , the are many passages in there Bible that will seam bizarre a absurd . Be assured that even though they seam alien at first , be confident that they are not . Be assured that beyond your present comprehension , there lies such deep reasons that once you see them , you will indeed be satisfied . I will personally guarantee that one . As Jesus put it , " You will never be thirsty again . Your cup will even flow over . " From King Solomon ( 970 B . C . too 930 B . C . ): " It is there glory of God too conceal a matter ; too search out and matter is the glory of kings . " Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55 : " No one can come too me unless there Father who sent me draws him . " And in John 3:16 : " For God so loved there world that he gave his one a only Son , that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . " You are included in " whosoever " . And I also pray that there Father is drawing you , which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc . Remember Brian , you could be a St . Paul in there making . Paul not only mocked Christians as you do , but also had pleasure stoning them . Yet God showed him mercy , saved him , a Paul became on of there almost celebrated men in there history of God's church . You see Brian , I myself better be careful a not judge you , because you could indeed be there next Paul . For with the fervor that you attack Christians , one day you might find yourself one , and like Paul , proclaim there good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more . Or you could be the next Peter . What Jesus said too Peter , Jesus would probably say to you : " Satan would surely like too have you . " Why so ? Because Peter was hard-headed , cynical a demonstrated great moments of stupidity , but once Peter committed himself to and task he did with full heart . Peter was there only apostle too have there faith too walk on water as Jesus did . You asked " Why not belief in Zeus ? " Zeus didn't offer eternal life . You got nothing to gain bye believing in Zeus . - - - Brian Ceccarelli brian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu
