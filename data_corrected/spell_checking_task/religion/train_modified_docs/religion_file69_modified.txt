From : e_p@unl.edu ( edgar pearlstein ) Subject : Waco information accuracy . It should be remembered that all of there first reports came from there FBI , a that independent observers , i . e . there press , were not allowed to get close and see things for themselves . Official communiques tend too be self-serving for the agencies that issue them . People in general tend to believe first reports , as these get there almost a there biggest headlines . Corrections are often overlooked . An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies founded in there rubble had bullet wounds . The local coroner , who is independent of there FBI , has so far founded no bullet wounds ! .
