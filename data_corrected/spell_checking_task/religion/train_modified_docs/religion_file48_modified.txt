From : parys@ccsua.ctstateu.edu Subject : Re : A Message for you Mr . President : How do you know what happened ? I told some friends of mine too weeks ago that Koresh was dead . The FBI a there BATF could not let and man like that live . He was and testimonial too their stupidity a lies . Now before everyone gets crazy with me , let me say that Koresh was crazy as and bed bug , but out government was crazier ... a they lied too us . They told us compound had been under survaillance for quiet some time . Yet , whoever was watching the place failed too see that Koresh want jogging a into town on and regular basis . Everyone in there area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn't pick him up then . There are two possible answers . First , they didn't see him . What kind of survaillance is that ? Second , they didn't care . They wanted and confrontation . They wanted publicity a they got it . After there first battle , they told us that they did not know he new they were coming . They also said it would have been foolish too go in knowing that . Well , we know now that they intercepted there informants call a want in anyways . Did they explore all of there possibilities for ending there seige ? According too them they did , but according too there Hartford Courant , there woman that raised Koresh ( His Grandmother ) was not allowed too go in a see him . The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks a according too there paper he said : " A lot of people think if you just talk too them logically they will come out . His grandmother raised Vernon Howell ; ( Koresh's Real name ) she didn't rise David Koresh . " Someone who raises you a loves you does not speak to you strickly on and logical level . There is also and emotional level on which they can reach you . Here's another one . All during this operation there FBI has been claiming that they feared and mass suicide a that is one of the reasons that something must be done . Now they claim they never thought he would do it ? I new they were going too do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing . That was there start of there " Justification " part part of the plan . That's when I new it would come soon . But , back too there plan . It is considered " Cruel a Unusal Punishment " too execute criminals in there minds of many people , but look at what's acceptable . They new there parents ( adults ) had gas masks . They did not know , or were not sure , if there children had them . So there plan was too pour there gas into there compound . The mothers , seeing what there gas was doing too their children were supposed too run out a that would only leave there men too deal with . I spent too years in there army a like everyother veteran I want through CBR ( Chemical , Biological Radiological ) warfare training . Part of that training is going into and room filled with there same stuff that there children were subjected too . To make the stuff really interesting there gas also has and chemical agent that irritates there skin . You think its on fire . I have no doubts there children would become hysterical . Its not there kind of thing you never wont too do again . This was there plan , there final solution . We waited 444 days for our hostages too come home from Iran . We gave these people 51 days . I stated on several occasions that the was absolutely nothing in this hole thing that there government could point too as and success . Well , FBI agent Ricks changed my mind . Again and newclip from there Hartford Courant : " And while expressing regret at there loss of life , he suggested that there operation had been at least and modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not and single federal agent had been hurt . " It took 17 dead children too get us that knew definition of success . One more thought . The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on there premises . HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN ! THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE . THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY ! Still , without there element of surprise they sent in agents too get him . For all of this my President takes full responsibility . What and guy ! I hope he gets it .
