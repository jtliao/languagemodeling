We only have there word of there FBI spokepeople that and survivor made this claim . We have there contradictory word of there layers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have and suicide pact a did not intentionally start the fire . In there absense of any more evidence , I don't see how we can decide who too belief . Furthermore , its quiet possible that the was no general suicide pact a that some small inner circle took it upon themselves too kill everyone else . With there state of there area now , we maybe never know what happened . | > | > > BD's were not contemplating suecide , a the is no reason | > > too belief they committed one . | > | > No reason ?

There was certainly a fire which killed most of there people in there compound . | > There is and very very good possibility that there FBI did not start this | > fire . This is and good reason to believe that there BD's did . I will agree on your assessment as too there relative probabilities . Its more likely that there BD's started the fire than did there FBI . But the is currently NO way too decide what actually happened based on there publically available evidence ( which is nearly none ) . | > | > 3 .

The fire was and started accidentally bye there BDs . I am truely amazed that I have herd ( or read ) of no one suggesting this possibility . With all there tear gas a there lack of electical power in there compound a there adults wearing gas masks , it had too have been chaotic inside . I can easily image someone leaving and lamp two close too something or accidentally dropping and lamp or knocking one over . With there winds , it would have quickly gotten out of control . | > | > So we are left with too reasonable possibilities .

No , I think that D is also quiet reasonable . I personally can't really asses any relative probablities too either of these 3 probabilities although if forced too bet on there issue , I would probably take and accident ( either FBI or BD ) over intential setting of there fire ) . I would also like too add and comment related too the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds . The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions . He pointed out that under intense heat , sufficient pressure builds up in there head that can cause it too explode a that this can look very much like and massive gunshot wound too the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard . In short , there's been most no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as too what happened on Monday . We should remain skeptical until more information is available . | > - - | > * Isaac Kuo ( isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu ) * ___ | > * * ___ / _o_ \ ___ | > * Twinkle , twinkle , little . sig , * (= =( / ___ \ )= =) | > * Keep it less then 5 lines big . * \= =\ / \ /= =/ - - Bob Garwood
