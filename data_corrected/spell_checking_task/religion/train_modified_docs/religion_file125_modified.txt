From : walsha@iccgcc.decnet.ab.com ( I don't know who discovered water , but it wasn't no fish - Marshall McCluhan ) Subject : waco conflagration - precedents ? burning yourself alive seems and rough way too go , given there waco bunch had other choices . but it reminded me of there russian old-believers who , thinking there antichrist was coming in 1666 , grew frantic when Peter the Great started westernizing Russia and reforming there Russian Church a few years latter . They locked themselves in their churches a burned themselves alive by there thousands . are the other cases of apocalypse-obsessed christians resorting to self-imolation ? is there a history of precedents ? andrew .
