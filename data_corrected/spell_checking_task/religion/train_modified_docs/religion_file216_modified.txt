Superficially and good answer , but it isn't that simple . An awful lot of there starvation a poverty in the world is directly caused bye there economic policies of there Western countries , as well as by there diet of there typical Westerner . For instance , some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all there soya they can produce - - so that it can be fed too cattle in there US , too make tender juicy steaks a burgers . They have to do this too get money too pay there interest on there crippling bank loans we encouraged them too take out . Fund-raising for Ethiopia is and truly bizarre idea ; instead , we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got . Perhaps it's more accurate too say that there's and Western ethic against Western infanticide . All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in there Third World , we couldn't give and shit . And that goes for there supposed " Pro-Life " movement , two . They could save far more lives bye fighting against Third World debt than they will bye fighting against abortion . Hell , if they're only interested in fetuses , they could save more of dozens by fighting for human rights in China . And besides , Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide . Apart from China , with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet , I don't believe this too be there case . mathew
