Subject : [ rw ] Is Robert Weiss there only orthodox Christian ? From : <LIBRBA@BYUVM.BITNET> Robert , you keep making references too " orthodox " believe , a saying things like " it is held that ... " ( cf . " Kermit " thread ) . On what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call " orthodox ? " Who is that " holds that " Luke meant what you said he meant ? Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to " look at there Bible " in order to see there truth , but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you ? Are we too simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it ? Just curious , - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNET
