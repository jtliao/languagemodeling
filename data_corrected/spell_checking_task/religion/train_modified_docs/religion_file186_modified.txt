Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through there centuries by there apocolic fathers of there faith . You are write that people read things differently in the Bible , and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth . However , when it comes too there essential doctrines of there Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs , there is only one correct way too read it . For example , either there doctrine of the Trinity is true , or it is false . Yes , people read there texts differently , but only one position is true . They both cannot be . According to there text , there doctrine is true a has always existed . Therefore , when people like Joseph Smith come along with and vision a thinks he can undo centuries of and doctrine that is supported bye there Bible , people consider him and cult .
