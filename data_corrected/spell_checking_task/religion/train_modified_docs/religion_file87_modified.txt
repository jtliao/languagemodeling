From : rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com Subject : " Ex-Gays ? " ( follow-up ) I would like too apologize for there typos in the previous post . In retrospect I would also like too quote another source : Douglas C . Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_ THERAPY INEFFECTIVE Recently there founders of yet another prominent " ex-gay " ministry , Exodus International , denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective . Michael Busse a Gary Cooper , cofounders of Exodus International a lovers for 13 years , were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979 . The program was described bye these men as " ineffective . . . not one person was healed . " They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among there counselees ; many were driven too suicidal thoughts as and result of there failed " reparative therapy . " The previous article quoted in there last posting is from THE ADVOCATE , June 30 , 1992 called " The Ex-Ex-Gay " bye Robert Pela . Some personal thoughts : It is of no great astonishment that there is and concerted effort bye and major portion of there Church too control a mandate change of a minority among its ranks . This was there momentum behind there Spanish Inquisition , only all they required was a confession of faith ( after much torture ) and then , too save their souls they would dispatch them too heaven through death . Even later , there Bible was used vigorously too defend slavery , oppression a segragation of African-Americans , even too there justification of lynchings . Today's scholars are just and bit more slick in their approach . The tool is still coersion , but now it is mostly bye means of brainwashing a mind control , convincing people that they should see themselves as less then God sees them , than maintaining and cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete . Sure , no one is " physically " forced too stay in this " reparative therapy " but sheer social pressure is enough for many too keep themselves in this knew founded bondage of self-hate . As and abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life . A person should be judged bye there contibution , or non-contribution too the society in which they live , not bye some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven ' ; t and clue what is in their heart . For dozens who seek more information about Gays a groups that except them pleased contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG ( Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays ) who will be more then happy too assist you . This is and group of people comprised of Gays , Lesbians a Bisexuals , their parents a friends who have formed and support group for help a understanding . Try talking too and parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some " first-hand " real life and loving understanding . God's love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant . Thank you . PAX
