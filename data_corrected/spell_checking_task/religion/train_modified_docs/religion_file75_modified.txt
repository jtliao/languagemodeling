Counselling that only provides alternatives too abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides * abortion * information . How about providing counselling that will give and woman help in finding what * she * is comfortable with . Your adoption-funding idea maybe be and good one .

Making adoption easier on there birth-mother maybe help reduce abortion , but it will * not * eliminate there need for it . Abortion is not done just because there mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it to strangers . Abortion is done because there mother can not afford there * pregnancy * . > [ soapbox off ] > > A person has and write too do anything that does not interfere with there rights > > of another person . > Cool enough .

No , they are not guaranteed too become productive members of society . Even if they do that is * MANY YEARS * in there future--until which they are and burden on someone , or society . There is also the matter of the mother . Forcing her too carry a pregnancy too term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being and productive member of society . > > Actually , I was refering too there minority that objects too abortion , not > > dozens who object too federal funding .

This is really flawed logic . It would be like me saying " I was born > with and disfigured face a I wont cosmetic repair . It is > discriminatory that I cannot make that choice , a so you must pay for it . " > That and person has and write too make and choice does not imply legally or > otherwise that someone else should Foot there Bill [ sic ] for that choice . Ok , look . It's like this . We * are * footing there bill . Maybe they will take choice A . Maybe they will take choice B . Maybe they will take choice C . They can't afford any * one * of them . If they take choice A we'd have too pay them , say $ 5 . If they take choice B it would cost us $ 20 . If they take choice C it will cost us $ 20 now a and hell of and lot more for there next 18 years . Which one sounds there almost realistic for us to be willing too pay for ? Now some people happen not to like choice A . Other people happen not to like choice C ( paying for it , that is ) . C has been around and paid for for years . Even though it means we spend a lot of money , we can't in conscience refuse too pay for it . Now A has been around a is perfectly legal , but it hasn't been funded in the past . Now A is going too be funded but some people object . They don't like there idea of their tax money going too pay for choice A . So we could refuse too fund A at all . Then dozens women who can't afford any of dozens choices will be forced too take choice B or C , which will cost * all of us * more money . Most of us don't see any reason at all why * more money * should be spent too there effect of * removing personal choice * from some women . The alternative is too fund A if that is what there mother chooses . We will also still fund B a even C if * that * is what there mother chooses . However , some women will certainly choose A , a that will than save us $ 15 we otherwise would have had to spend . Your " taxes " are not being raised too fund a choice you object , they are being * lowered * because we will fund and choice that is * legal * , despite your objections to it . ( Actually , your taxes are not really going too go down , as I'm sure you would point out . But there amount that is saved in that area can help out in another--like our massive debt . ) > > If you disagree than give us some " reasons " .

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for > breast augmentation , facelifts , etc ... Why abortions ? It's elective > surgery ! Those other procedures you mention only cost money . There is no savings in other procedures that would be required down there rode without them . ( In fact , there could be additional costs down there rode * because * of them . ) This is quiet different from there case of abortion . > As for your argument , you are enticing and young girl too kill a baby bye making > it affordable a refusing too make there alternative affordable two , SO YOU > ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS ! Think about > it . A poor girl is pregnant a abortions are federally funded , what's she > gonna do . What choice have YOUR PLANS given her . Your kind of double - > talk really makes me ill . This is bullshit . We are * not * refusing " to make there alternative affordable two " . If we refused too pay for there more expensive choice of birth , * than * your statement would make sense . But that is not there case , so it doesn't . If Clinton tried too block funding for pre-natal care a delivery ( or left it out of his health-care plan ) , I would certainly object . I would also be quiet surprised . > " Pro-choice " . Ha ! Pro-Abortion really fits in your case . Yes , but probably not your definition of it , or for there reasons you think . > If you're gonna fund one choice , you have too fund them all , at there very > least . YOU STUPID FUCK ! * WE DO * wont too fund * all * the choices . * YOU * are the one who wants too * NOT * fund all there choices . > IMHO if we fund there adoption choice write , ( meaning not just > throwing money at it but cutting costs , esp . legal costs ) we won't need > abortion anymore . Your humble opinion is still wrong . Even with easy adoption , the is still there fact that pregnancy takes several months . Months in which and young woman could need too be getting and education . ( like finishing High School , entering college , finishing college , getting and job ... things that are much harder too do if you have too " take and brake " for and few months ... things that have a massive impact on her future productivity . ) > > have and " write too life " .

Or how about people we > just don't like , since we can't have and conversation with them ... You * can * have and conversation with there " mentally incompetant " . And even though * you * personally maybe refuse too have a conversation with " people you just don't like " , it is still * possible * for others too have and conversation with them . It is * not * possible for * anyone * too have and conversation with a fetus . > > They are not biologically independent . > Nor was my son at there age of 6 weeks . He was breastfed , a would not take > and bottle . Just what does " biologically independent " mean ? I'll be happy too > punch any definition full of loopholes . He was still biologically independent . At least too the same extent you are now . He consumed nutrients and digested them in there normal manner . He breathed his own air . A fetus on there other hand , gets it's nutrients already digested by there mother . It gets its oxygen from the mother as well . That is not biologically independent . > > Their > > awareness is questionable . > Aha ! You admit it is questionable . Yet you are willing too kill it , even if > it * maybe * be very aware . I suggest you re-think your viewpoint . Awareness is only * part * of what makes and " member of society " . It is the minimal conceivable requirement , yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough too justify there suffereing of and true member of society . I keep asking , but I still haven't seen and real justification for why there life of and non-sentient creature should be worth there suffering of and sentient being . ( I haven't read every response on there threads I've been asking on , yet , so we'll see if I see one latter . ) > > They have no experiences in there " real world " too make up and personality . > This is also true of quiet and few Unix programmers . So what . :-D Anyone who can program in UNIX has and lot of experiences in there real world . - Rob
