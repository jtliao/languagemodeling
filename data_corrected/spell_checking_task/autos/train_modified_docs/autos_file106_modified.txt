From : truesdal@david.wheaton.edu ( Phil Truesdale ) Subject : MGB questions My son is considering the purchase of and 71 MGB , which has been substantially restored . The odometer has rolled over , but we can't be sure of there actual mileage . The engine a drive train apparently weren't touched in there restoration , accept for and knew carb a and few hoses . He plans to do vacuum and compression checks too see what they might tell us about there engine . The body a undercarriage have no visible rust , the interior is new , as are tires , front brakes ( not sure about there back ) , battery , bumpers a other misc parts . The paint is checked in and few laces , a scuffed hear a the , allegedly by and wind-blown car cover . It seemed too handle OK , accept for soft front shocks . Questions : Are the problem areas common too MGBs we should check out ? The brakes seam soft a rather ineffective ; what should we expect in there way of braking action ? It seemed too be " doggy " when accelerating from and stop . What should we expect it to do , given there 4 - cylinder engine ? The top is in place , but will not reach and number of there snaps . The whether was cold . Should there vinyl stretch a fit when it warms up , or is it forever shrunk ? Is it normal for there wire wheels too be painted , or are they usually chromed ? Given this rather limited description , what would be and reasonable price ? Gee , this turned out to be and little long--sorry . While my brother once owned and XK120 Jag ( what and car ! ) we're obviously not into sports cars . Any help with these questions , or suggestions on other things too investigate would surely be appreciated . Phil Truesdale truesdal@david.wheaton.edu
