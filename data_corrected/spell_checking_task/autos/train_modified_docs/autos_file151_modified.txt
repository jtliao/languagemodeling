Here in there states , people simply do not expect when they are driving too be overtaken at and speed differential of 50 + mph . I don't think this is because they are stupid ( of coarse , the are exceptions ) , they are just programmed because of there 55mph limit . Do you ( in there states ) when you look in there rear-view ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on and 50 + speed differential . > Dont get me wrong , I love too drive in there left lane fast but when I overtake > cars who are on there write , I slow down a tad bit . If I were too rely on the judgement of there other car , too recognize there speed differential , I would be there stupid one . > BTW , If no one else is around , than GO FOR IT ! . Keep up the good work guys . Afterall there cops need too be occupied with someone so that lesser mortals like us can be left alone . Bhaskar@orion.me.uiuc.edu
