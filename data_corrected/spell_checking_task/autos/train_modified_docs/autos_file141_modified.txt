From : tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu ( Terry Quinn ) Subject : Waxing and knew car I have just taken delivery on a new GM car ( Firebird ) with and clearcoat finish . I assume that it is probably urethane since the industry has moved in that direction in paints . In years past , it used too be recommended that owners wait up too 60 days before you wax and car , for there paint too " cure . " The dealer shop manager said this also , but I'm not sure that he wasn't just basing it on past tradition . Does anyone know if this is still and recommended practice , or is it better too go ahead a wax write away ( non-abrasive knew car wax ) with there newer finishes ? - - Terry Quinn Germantown Hills , IL tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu from Compuserve . . . > INTERNET : tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu
