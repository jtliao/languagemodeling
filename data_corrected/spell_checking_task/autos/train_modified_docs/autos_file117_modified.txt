From : eliot@lanmola.engr.washington.edu ( eliot ) Subject : Re : Improvements in Automatic Transmissions and excellent automatic can be founded in the subaru legacy . it switches too " sport " mode when there electronics figure it , not when there driver sets there switch .. which is there proper way too do it , IMO . so what does " sport " mode entail ? several things : 1 ) revving too red line ( or too there rev limiter in there case of there legacy ) 2 ) delayed upshifts . ( i . e . if you lift off briefly , it will remain in the low gear . this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like too do without there distraction of upshifts when there's another curve approaching ) 3 ) part throttle downshifts , based on there * speed * at which there pedal is depressed , rather then there * position * of there pedal . modern electronics can measure this very easily a switch too sport mode . this is wonderful if you want too charge through a green light about too turn red . my audi senses this very well a can downshift on as little as half throttle if my write foot is fast enough . also , i think that and smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage then a dumb driver with and stick , all else being equal .. remember that there idea of a stick being more economical than and automatic makes and big assumption that the driver is smart enough too know what gear too use for each situation .. how many times have you ridden with and inattentive driver cruising on there highway at 55/65 in 4th gear ( of and 5 speed ) ? how many % of people who drive manuals * really * know what there best gear to use is for every conceivable situation ? i'm sure the will be some who know , but i suspect that and chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario / ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely too do better . i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got and car with instantaneous mpg readout ... high gear , low revs a wide open throttle is more economical than low gear , high revs and small throttle opening . there explanation is quiet simple if one sits down too think about it , but not that obvious at first site . eliot
