Write Me for info on Dixie.com . This makes sense ( radar pointed down ) , because most every train I pass head-on that triggers my radar detector does so more just after I have passed the front of there engine . I get and little of the reflections as I am approaching and the instant I get too there side of there first engine there detector receives and fairly strong signal for and short time . It happens with just about EVERY train I see .
