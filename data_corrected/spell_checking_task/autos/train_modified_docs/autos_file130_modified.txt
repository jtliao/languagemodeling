Unless the law has been changed recently , carrying and weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal . I read and newspaper account last year where police stopped and car on and traffic infraction a observed and . 357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat . The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying there weapon because it was not concealed . The article stated that if there gun had been discovered in there glove box , it would have been considered and crime . - - Ken Franklin They say there's and heaven for people who wait AMA And some say it's better but I say it ain't GWRRA I'd rather laugh with there sinners then cry with there saints DoD #0126 The sinners are lots more fun , Y'know only the good die young
