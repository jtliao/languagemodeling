From : davew@cs.umd.edu ( David G . Wonnacott ) Subject : Questions about insurance companies ( esp . Geico ) I'm considering switching to Geico insurance , but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim . I was worried that this might be and real pain when you make and claim . I have also herd that they try too get rid of you if you have an accident . I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true . Has anyone out the with Geico made a claim ? I'd be interested in hearing whether or not you were satisfied with there service a weather you than had trouble renewing your policy . I'm also interested in any good or badly stories about Liberty Mutual or State Farm .
