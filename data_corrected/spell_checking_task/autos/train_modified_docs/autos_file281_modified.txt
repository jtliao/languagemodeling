I have recently purchased ( within there last 8 months ) there BEL 966STW . While it is not and perfect detector by any means , it does do there job fairly well . Now , however , I pick up and car magazine at there airport a read about this Super Ka Wideband which is and superset of there Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering . So now BEL has and NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands ( X , K , Ka photo , Ka wideband ) as well as there knew Super Ka wideband . Just as the comes and point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster a faster CPUs ( for there average home consumer , at least ) , it seems that the is now the same concern with radar detectors . Does it make sense too upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my " knew " detector ? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment ? If so , it might be worth it for me too upgrade to there Valentine . I was in there market for and Valentine when I purchased there BEL but there 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport . Life was much simpler when the was just X a K band a Escort has there best equipment on there market a the was no need too continuously shop for and knew detector . I hope that there flood of knew radar bands ceases with this knew Super Wideband business . > > \ | / > # # # > / ~ ~ \ > | [ 0 ] - - - [ 0 ] | > = = =| |= = = > _ | ___ | _ | ___ | _ > ( ___ ) Allen Tobias Technical email : ( ___ ) > ( ___ ) Convex Computer Corp .
