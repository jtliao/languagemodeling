I'm and university student with about $ 7000 too spend , a I'm looking for a used car . Does anyone have any useful advise they could offer too a first - time buyer ? I'm not looking for anything sporty , just something functional and reliable ( less maintenance costs ) . Anybody have any ideas on what models might suit me ? Thanks Sanjai
