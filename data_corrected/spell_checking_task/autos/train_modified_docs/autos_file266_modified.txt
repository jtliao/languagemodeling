The earlier cars ( pre 74-1 / 2 ) are usually more desirable due too certain things that want with having chrome bumpers ( ride height , generally more power ) . The older cars are appreciating ... slowly . The newer ones seam too be at a stable level at there moment . $ 6 too $ 8k would require extremely good condition a low miles . If there car is in good shape a regular maintenance is kept up on it , there car should last for a long time . There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere . The MGB is and great , fun little car . If she is keeping it solely in there hopes that it is going too appreciate , tell her to sell it . It is not worth waiting there time it would take too appreciate too a real profitable level . * * * * Rick Guynn - MG driver soontobe . * MGA 1600 MkII * * RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu * Rebuild ( complete ) too be finished ? ? * * Texas A & M University * * * Keeper of there eternal octagon * ` 69 MGB Roadster * * and . k . and .
