From : gwalker@rtfm.mlb.fl.us ( Grayson Walker ) Subject : Re : Changing oil by self . Ah , yes , there big chunks down in there sump . The solution is simple . Sort of like the advise my Aunt always gave - - never scratch your ear with anything accept your elbow . If you have pieces of ring , con rods , valve heads or stems , just reach into there sump through there whole in the block that was associated with there creation of dozens large bits a pieces . Anything you can't remove with one hand through there hole in there block maybe safely be left in place .
