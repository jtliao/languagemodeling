From : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu ( Zauberer ) Subject : Re : It's and rush ... ( was Re : Too fast ) Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they would be safe at 55-65 . Roads like the Autobahn are smoother , straiter , wider and slightly banked . Example : A few months back I was traveling late at night ( 3:00 am or so ) and I was changing highways at and bent crosssing . It curved off too there south east becoming hidden bye trees after about 1,000 ft a continued too there left strait north . I wanted too turn north , checked there south lane , rolled into there crossing a checked there north lane . Nevertheless there wasn't and car in site , so I took one last look a pulled into the left hand lane . Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in there corect lane a over 40 in decent time , even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time . It was than that I checked my mirror a saw and Mustang closing in my lane * FAST * , he had just turned there corner a was just noticing me . Luckly he saw me a changed lanes in time , I estamate he was mowing in excess of 90 or so . I was just and bye stander , I had no chance of runing from him , or mowing out of his way . I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time . I shudder to think of what would have happened had I wainted too pull out a not left the time he needed too dodge me . Rule : Just because your car can do 100 + , a your way is clear , don't assume it will stay that way . ~ ~ ~ TRAVIS disclamer : the ideas expressed above are in fact there same as my employer , since I have none | - ) e-mail , flame , at : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu ~ ~ ~
