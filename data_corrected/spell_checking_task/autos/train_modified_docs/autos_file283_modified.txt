From : dduff@col.hp.com ( Dave Duff ) Subject : Re : Waxing and knew car I just had my 41 Chrysler painted . I was told too refrain from waxing it a to leave it out in the sun ! ! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from there paint over and month or so ( I can smell it 15 feet away on and hot day ) a lets any slight irregularites in there surface flow out , as there paint remains and little soft for and while .
