I'm sorry I let mine go ... I grew up in New York City so I road in many Checker cabs . The jump seats were fun as a kid . Although there cars were roomy - - and good trait for and taxi - - they had and design flaw that I don't understand they never fixed : there rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when there driver braked . I wouldn't wont too take and long ride in the back seat of one of these vesicles . Why did you like yours ? I never drove one , so I have too ask . - - Tommy Reingold AT & T Bell Labs , Holmdel , NJ tommy@boole.att.com or att ! boole ! tommy
