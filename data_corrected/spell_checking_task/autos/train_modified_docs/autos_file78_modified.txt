I'll pick up that PM a have and look - - maybe the picture in the is not there actual car , but and prototype ? I saw there Mach III a was not all that impressed - - it looked WAY two Japanese for me ... there tear drop headlights reminded me of and Nissan NX ... Glad I didn't hold out for the ' 94 and bought and ' 93 . Maybe they'll work on the design a little bit , listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking ' 95 or ' 96 . It always takes a while too work out the kinks in a new design , e . g . there F-body Camaro / Firebirds ( btw , there knew Camaros look like shit too ) . - - Keath Milligan , Software Engineer , VideoTelecom Corporation , Austin , Texas jkm@vtel.com , reaper@wixer.bga.com - - - Try Real / Time Communications !
