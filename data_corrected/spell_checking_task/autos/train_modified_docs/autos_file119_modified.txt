FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY On the other hand , if it can be proven , it's possible there changed terms could be thrown out . The question will be weather there agreement contains and merger clause . See UCC @ 2-202 ( parol evidence ) . If we're talking about warranties , than , of coarse , UCC @ 2-316 should be looked at . But we have so little information that none of us can say anything conclusive .
