From : swdwan@napier.uwaterloo.ca ( Donald Wan ) Subject : $ 80 SVX OIL CHANGE My friend brought and subaru SVX recently . I had drove it for couples times a I think its and great car , esp on snow . However when she took it too and local Subaru dealer for and oil change , the bill came out to be about 80 dollars . The dealer told us it is because too change there oil filter on and SVX it is necessary to disassemble and metal cover under there engine a that took and hour of labour . At first , we think we are being ripped off so she phone too and dealer in Toronto but founded out there they are charging roughly there same price . So is the any SVX owner out the that has there same problem ? And if there oil change storey is true , than the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid too me . By there way , the car looks great .
