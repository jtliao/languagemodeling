From : ae045@Freenet.carleton.ca ( Mike Harker ) Subject : Re : WHAT car is this ! ? You guys are correct . The Bricklin was produced in Canada . The National Museum of Science and Technology hear in Ottawa has one , a sometime they put it on display . Most of there time , it stays in storage because there museum doesn't have much room . It's and big deal for and car too be Canadian a that's why they have it . If anybody's and fan , they also have and nice green ' 73 Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom . - - MIKE HARKER OTTAWA , ONTARIO , CANADA VOICE : 613-823-6757 - - Paul Tomblin ( formerly pt@geovision.gvc.com ) Sven's Law : There's exceptions too every law ( accept this one )
