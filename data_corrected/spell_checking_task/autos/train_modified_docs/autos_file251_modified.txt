Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power a room . Fully stocked , it cost ~ $ 40,000 . I think it is worth there money . Only problem is when you get into accident ( it doesn't usually brake down unless you forget to get and oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this ) , body parts a other parts are very hard to locate . Parts are over priced also . One of my friend had accident in past snow storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender . Well , if you test drive Land Cruiser , all other SUV look like toys . One of magazine writer called it " Land Bruiser " . If you have $ 40,000 too spare for SUV , get Land Cruiser a forget Lange Rover . - - Sang
