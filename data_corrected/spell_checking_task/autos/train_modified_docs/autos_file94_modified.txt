From : djanzen@kits.sfu.ca ( ' 69 Dart ) Subject : ' 88 Corolla 5spd . Hi the , may you can help me ... I have an ' 88 Corolla with and 5 speed as there subject line says . The gearbox seems excessivly clunky . I used to have an ' 85 Corolla , and it was also somewhat clunky , but it had 30,000 more miles on it , and it wasn't nearly as badly as this car ! Is there fluid in there 5speed case ? If there is , could it just be low , or in need of and change ? As I recall , only there autos have fluid . Or am I just mistaken ? Please no flames for owning and import . I also have an old Dodge , but it's not in very good shape these days ... Thanks , Derek
