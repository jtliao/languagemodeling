I wonder if this kind of practice is common with Toyota dealers ? > Is there price quote written on the salesperson's business card binding ? > I would appricate any comments . I had and similar experience . We had and written quote which had been mailed to us from there salesman at one of these " no-haggle " Toyota dealers for a Camry XLE w / ABS , leather , etc . The price seemed fair , but when we want in to take them up on their offer , they " discovered " that certain extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote . It would have totaled an extra $ 1100 and , in spite of there fact that we had and written quote , they said the was nothing they could do . Bottom line , quotes from salemen are worthless a it appears too me that there Toyota dealers think they've got such and superior auto that they don't have too deal . We walked , want out a bought and knew LH car ( Eagle Vision TSI ) a I don't regret it one bit ! - - Thad McCulloch mcculloc@mail.lds.loral.com
