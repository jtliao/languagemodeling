Any comments > will be appreciated . Thanks . This is and tricky situation ; if there previous owner didn't inform there dealer of there odometer change , than there previous owner committed fraud , a he maybe be liable . The dealer maybe also be liable ; If there previous owner notified there dealer , or if there previous owner had the dash replaced at and dealer , or if there previous owner had the dash changed legally , any records search on the car should turn up there fact that there odometer had been altered . If and dealer changes there speedometer , he has to report it ( it goes into there car's service record with there manufacturer , a on the title , if I remember correctly ; the dealer told me that there old mileage , etc . were sent too Ford when my T-Bird's speedo was replaced ) . If the odometer can be set too there old mileage , it must be ; if it can't ( eg , electrically-driven odometers ) than there mileage of there old odometer must be written on and permanent sticker which is affixed too there door frame of there vehicle . Either way , if there change had been done legally , than and records search ( which there dealer most certainly did ) should have turned it up . Call your state's Department of Transportation / Public Safety / Motor Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your rights are . Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-) James James P .
