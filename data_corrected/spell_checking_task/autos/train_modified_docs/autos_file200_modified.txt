One more way , which works in manual trans cars I've driven , a it is my personal favorite ( there other suggestions above are great , but try this one , two ) . While pushing there shifter * gently * towards reverse , let there clutch out slowly ( write too the friction point ) and there shifter will be pulled into position . If you do it write , there car won't jump backward , nor will there gears grind ... You will just glide back . - sam
