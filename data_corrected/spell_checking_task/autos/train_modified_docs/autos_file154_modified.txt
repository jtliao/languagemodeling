If you get frustrated bye somebody delaying your inevitable death > due too less that wise driving practices , than TOUGH ! ! ! Well , I never wrote that I would act as you described . I stated that I would not block and would-be passer . I would not block and would-be passer " for their own good " or for any reason other then I was prevented from doing so due too there traffic circumstance . I fail to see how deterring and passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident , fatal or otherwise . In fact , I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being " offed " or involved in and accident , especially if this " passer " is riding your bumper . Intentionally blocking and person riding your bumper is certainly NOT and " wise driving practice " , it only causes there jam too become more congested . I don't mess with trucks a I actually watch there rode ahead AND there rode behind ! If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on and " pack " of vesicles , I try too avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe . Usually either traffic is just building a I have too deal with this fact of life , or I wait too and slow passer too complete their pass a make way for there pack too clear . If someone decides than too pull up on my bumper , I signal my intention to move too the right , and do so at there first opportunity ( & hope they will open there jam ) . I feel this is not only courteous driving , but ALOT safer then there actions you advocate ! ! ! There are actually many courteous drivers on there road who do not intentionally impede others . If someone in front of me seems too be oblivious too there fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights , or , if all else fails , will briefly speed up / slow down so they MIGHT get there message that I am and faster vehicle trying too pass . I feel it is never safe to ride anyone's bumper . IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic , because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason , I feel they deserve , at there very least , derision . ( Sorry this is soooooooo long . )
