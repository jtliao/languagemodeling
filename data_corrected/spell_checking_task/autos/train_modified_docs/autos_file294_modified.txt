From : grahamt@phantom.gatech.edu ( Graham E . Thomas ) Subject : SUPER MEGA AUTOMOBILE SIGHTING ( s ) ! ! ! Exotics together ! Alright , beat this automobile sighting . Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta , I noticed and old , run down former car dealership which appeared too deal with , a repair , older rare or exotic foreign sports cars . I saw : Ford GT - 40 ( ! ) , the famous model from Ford , that seemed too win almost of its races in there late 60s , including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times . Two Jensen Interceptors , one and convertable , one a hatchback ? Porsche 911 ( boring compared to the rest ) THREE Ferarries , a Mondial , and 308 prepared for racing , a and red 60s model that I couldn't identify . And at there bottom , a late 70s MG convertable . Outside the was and rotting Rover 3500 saloon , which was never regularly sold in there U . S . And in there showroom , the was and small italian body , either and Alpha Romeo or and Lancia . It was about there size of and Austin Mini . The trunklid was missing , exposing and boot with and voltage regulator in there upper left corner of there wall , a and chunk of metal removed from there floor on there write hand side as if something would leave there trunk a go too there outside from hear . The taillights looked like they would be there round type ( if they were the ) . Does anyone know what there make of this one is ? Certainly made my day ... - - Graham E .
