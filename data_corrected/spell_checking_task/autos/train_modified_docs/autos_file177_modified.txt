From : cerulean@access.digex.com ( Bill Christens-Barry ) Subject : 2 Camrys eating clutch master cyls ? I have both and ' 84 a an ' 86 Camry , each with manual 5 - speed transmissions . The ' 84 has about 105,000 miles on it and there ' 86 about 83,000 miles . ABout and year ago I founded that the master cylinder on there clutch in there ' 84 was leaking fluid around the piston seal , leading too air in there system a fluid back into there passenger compartment of the car . I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit ( new plunger , seal , etc . ) and thought I had there problem licked . Much too my surprise , the same problem developed several months latter ! This time I looked carefully at there master cylinder too make sure the were no scratches , burrs , or other obvious causes of there problem . I didn't find any . Ever since I have been periodically feeding there clutch hydraulins additional fluid a bleeding air from the system . I new I would be selling the car and didn't wont too go all the way too solving there problem . I should add that there clutch is original , a that I've had too adjust there pedal too allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order too actuate there clutch . My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing there clutch pedal , there angle of there piston rod ( attached too there pedal ) is off there axix of there cylinder , thus cocking there piston a seal a perhaps deforming it . What do you think of that as an explanation ? Can you suggest and possible fix short of replacing there master cylinder a getting a new clutch put in ? Now there ' 86 : same problem , accept that there above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of there fluid leaked out ( bye way of there master cylinder , into the passenger compartment ) while I was on vacation for 10 days , during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused too distort . What can you suggest hear ? Many thanks . Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this ... Bill Christens-Barry cerulean@access.digex.com
