They have and streak of meanness that runs much deeper a stronger then anything I ever experienced even during there height of the 60 ' s racial struggles . I am absolutely convinced that the are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong , but have there human intelligence which is turning them into there greatest predators that have ever walked there earth . They will prevail unless there rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans , and for individuals too start taking some responsibility for their own protection . In and state in which there individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection , there police a government is soon composed of there very feral humans that they originally sought protection from . Gee , I guess you touched my hot button . I'd better go cool off somewhere . - - Tom Mackey (206) 865-6575 tomm@voodoo.ca.boeing.com Boeing Computer Services ... uunet ! bcstec ! voodoo ! tomm M / S 7K - 20 , P . O .
