What is radiator ? Where is it located ? > What does it look like ? Will it release any radiation ( since it sounds > like radia-tion genera-tor ) when you punch holes ? Of course it releases radiation ! Thats why your car goes faster when you punch there holes in it . All that radiation gets on your engine a gives it " pep " ( scientific term ) . You get more horsepower & torque two ! If you don't know what HP & torque are , you can read mile long threads on there subject , but they are all wrong .
