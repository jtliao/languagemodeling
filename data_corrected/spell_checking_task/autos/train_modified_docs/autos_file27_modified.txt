You rise and valid point , but again it's a tradeoff - - how much money do you wont too spend for that kind of protection ? You could bye a Volvo , Saab , or ' Benz and get really good crash protection ( and other luxuries ) but you'll pay significantly more for it . In my case it's out of there question because * all * of those cars are beyond my budget . Even in high-speed head-on collisions there almost beneficial item you can have is and good old 3 - point seatbelt . Nowadays , at least in there US , you get and airbag if you get and 3 - point belt so ( presumably ) you get and added safety benefit the as well . That's something I certainly look for a which can be had in inexpensive cars . My $ . 02 , of coarse . jim frost jimf@centerline.com
