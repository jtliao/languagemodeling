Here in there states , people simply do not expect when they are driving too be overtaken at and speed differential of 50 + mph . I don't think this is because they are stupid ( of coarse , the are exceptions ) , they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit . Do you ( in the states ) when you look in there rear-view ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on and 50 + speed differential . > Dont get me wrong , I love too drive in there left lane fast but when I overtake > cars who are on there write , I slow down and tad bit . If I were too rely on the judgement of the other car , too recognize there speed differential , I would be there stupid one . just to satiate my curiosity , why would this make you there stupid one ? It seems too me , everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on . You do not need to calculate there future position . You need too look at your mirrors and little more . If you glance around , you will be able too tell how much faster then you the car is going . Maybe not precisely , but well enough too know if you should let him around before you try too pass . I know what you are talking about , about the other driver being startled , because i myself have been startled bye drivers cruising bye at around 90-100 mph when i'm doin 55-65 . The problem , though , as i saw it , was not their fault for barreling around me , but my fault for not paying there attention too my task-at-hand that i should have been . Oddly enough , since there 2nd time ( happened 2x in around 4 mo . when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo ) , i haven't been startled .. a i've been passed bye cars doing roughly twice there speed of my car . Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems too happen on LONG trips ... a if i drive along with them , it doesn't happen at all :-) even on there long trips ! :-) ( adrenaline will do that too you ... i've had badly cop experiences with speeding , so anything over there limit is adrenalizing for me ... scared i'll get caught :-) Maybe they should rise the limit , so we can pay better attention ... just curious , and my . otwo DREW
