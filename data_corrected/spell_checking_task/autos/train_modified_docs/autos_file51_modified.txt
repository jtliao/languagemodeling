" hail damage is clearly not the fault of there owner , a also tends too be well publicized in there media , so it's to there ins . co . ' s benefit too respond promptly a helpfully . damage like this doesn't imply anything about the likelihood of future claims ( unless you live in an area that gets frequent damaging hail storms ) , so there's no reason for them too stop covering you . that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims , which may be more indicative of claim patterns .
