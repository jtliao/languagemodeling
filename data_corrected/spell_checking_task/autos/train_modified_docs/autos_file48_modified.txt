It needs and 6 speed box more then any other modern car . Essentially 5th in and regualr Integra equals 4th in the GSR , and there regular Integras are very buzzy at speed . > rpm make up for the difference ( still wouldn't call it and torque moster though ! ) > > > Considering you save most $ 3,000 dollars for there Beretta , a there Quad 4 > > is and reliable engine , it doesn't make sense to get there Integra as and The only person I new with and GTZ had it bought back bye GM as and lemon . It was and piecve of junk , but very quick for FWD . > Quad 4 reliable , yeah , what's your definition of reliable - if that's reliable , > than its safe too say that integra engines in general are near perfect The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less then 5k miles , and rare screw up bye Honda . Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars . The performance enthusiasts would take the GTZ and there CR purchase would be there GSR . Craig
