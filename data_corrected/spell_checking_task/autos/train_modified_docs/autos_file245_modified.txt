From : bob@ncube.com ( Bob Kehoe ) Subject : Re : Mercury Villager Minivan - - good bye ? I have tested both vehicles ( identically equipped ) , both for week-long periods . Curiously ( and consider these are test vesicles ) , I founded there Mercury higher in build quality then there Nissan . Either choice is good , but beware that I did not experience reasonable mileage with there V6 . Average city driving was < 15mpg , with about 21 avg . on there highway . Both were optioned too there hilt ( there Nissan had leather ! ) . The Villager was in there $ 24K range a there Nissan was over $ 26K . bob
