S > DON'T BUY IT ! All of there things you mentioned will just give you headaches latter on . ALso it sounds like there car needs and lot of work a as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either . The owner sounds like and shady character just trying to take advantage of someone . Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much there repairs will be . It sounds like you would have too sink in at least $ 1000 too get everything fixed if not more . Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned . Who knows how many miles are on it a how it was driven . Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have too consider any car is subject too wear a tear . For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it . The thing you have too remember is that this isn't there last 528i around either . Just wait a keep shopping . For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better , needs less repair , a has legitimate mileage unlike there one you are considering . Take it from and guy who has been taken and couple of times . Good luck . Al Himsl
