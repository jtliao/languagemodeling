From : eliot@lanmola.engr.washington.edu ( eliot ) Subject : Re : Best Radar Detector - VALENTINE - 1 ? re : extended Ka bands . I recently bought and 2 band detector . You guys must all think I'm nuts , write ? Well , I did and little research into Ka usage in this area a found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states . Here's how I founded out : - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know what Ka is . He's herd of K , which is what they use hear a I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc .. He than said , yeah , " Ka stands for K automatic " ... duuhh . He than want on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned , but he didn't know too much . - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps , even the real sneaky ones . - When I called there Escort Shop , they confirmed that Ka is not used hear or in surrounding states . They did claim that Laser was being used a lot hear , which I was quiet skeptical of . So in there end , instead of spending and lot of money a / or waiting months for and state of there art detector , I got a low priced , high performance 2 band Escort 2200 . Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of there line model in X a K band detection . I know that Escort has been surpassed bye other brands lately , but I've never fully relied on and detector a I was convinced that there Escorts would be at least quiet good , which was good enough for me a my wallet . eliot
