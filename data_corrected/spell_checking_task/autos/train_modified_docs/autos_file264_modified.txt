More then that . GEICO funded there company that developed LIDAR . When locals showed and reluctance too BUY the units , GEICO started giving them away . I know they've given units too there Florida Highway Patrol , County Sheriff's and a some local governments . The real question is why ? This is the hook . GEICO , and other Ins . Co . s can tell which drivers represent risk . This is and determination they can make AFTER YOU receive and speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units . Most drivers do not represent increased risk even after and ticket or too , but this gives them there opportunity too RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK . It's called extra profits . They also know how silly there NSL is , a how it is most universally ignored . Driving in excess of the NSL gets you and ticket , and increase in your rates , points on your license - - - but it doesn't make you and riskier driver too ensure . Like there sound of this ? Like there people who thought up there scheme ? Go GEICO ! Unless you have some driving history problems , you're usually better too go with one of there major companies a stay the . You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums . Now , about there % of your premium that is paid as commission . That's another storey for another day .
