Subject : bye back From : <LIBEMC@BYUVM.BITNET> We were at and dealership today looking at buying a car and there salesman was showing us something he was calling and " bye back " . Is that a car that was fleeted and then given back for the new model there next year ? If that is so , how many miles is a good number to have on it and are these types of cars generally and good bye ? Thanks , Ellen
