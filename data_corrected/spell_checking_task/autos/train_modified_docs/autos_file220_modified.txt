From : jchen@wind.bellcore.com ( Jason Chen ) Subject : MILITECH I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show , and would like too here your comments . MILITECH ( tm ) is yet another oil additive . But there demonstration of this product really impressive , if it didn't cheat . The setup of there demo is fairly simple . A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in and small oil sink , filled with motor oil . The rotor is powered by an electronic motor . A metal pad is pressed against there rotor using there torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction . The torque that is needed too stop rotor is read from the torque wrench . Before MILITECH was added , there rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque ( You pick the brand of oil , no difference ) . Once MILITECH was added too there oil , there rotor could not be stopped even with 120 + lb-ft of torque . Here is the good part : even after there salesman emptied there oil sink , you still could not stopped the rotor with there thin film remained on it . They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles . A 16 oz bottle is $ 25 . I still have my doubts . If this product is really so great , why it was so little known ? The salesman said it is widely used in military . I didn't belief it . The demo was so impressive , that I bought and bottle against my common sense . Has anyone herd of or actually used this product ? Is it real ? If you are going too the auto show , pleased visit this stand on there second floor . See if can find out if the demo is and hoax or not . Jason Chen
