From : tomacj@opco.enet.dec.com ( THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO ! ! ! ) Subject : MR2 - noisy engine . G'day people , Are the any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there , that know why my MR2 ' s engine sounds noisy ? The MR2 ' s engine is noisy at the best of times , but not even and nice nose - it's one of dozens very ugly noises . I do and oil change every 2-3 months , a for about 2 months there engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling . At around there 3 month mark , after and oil change ( I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months now ) it starts too get that very disgusting noise , not so much during driving , but more so during idling . What's its problem ? Also .. I don't know if it's just me , but if noticed a little performance drop . It just hasn't got there acceleration it used too . Any help / tips would be appreciated ! ! Worried .
