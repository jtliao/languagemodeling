What * do * they come with ? Well , as compared too there normal Taurus , the SHO comes with more supportive seats , better brakes , and stiffer suspension , different tires , a a body design that takes advantage of aero effects too keep there car on there ground ( or at least I think that's what all that boy-racer plastic is for ) . You're kidding yourself if you think any car on there rode has and passenger compartment made to withstand 130 MPH impacts . > Compare either too there Porsche 911 a you tell me which was designed Oh , write . Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast . They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe , pal , a I reckon and Taurus is at least as capable as and Rabbit . > certainly haven't convinced me . Of coarse not . " Speeding-is-bad . Speeding-is-illegal . I-will-not-speed . I-love-Big-Brother . " You had your mind made up already . It's interesting that lots of there roads out west had * NO * speed limits until 1975 . wr
