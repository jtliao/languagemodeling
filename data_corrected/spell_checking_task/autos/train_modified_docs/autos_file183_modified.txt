From : Jay Lorenzana <U40348@uicvm.uic.edu> Subject : Eagle Talon TSi--LEMON ? Dear Netters : I am looking too bye and used Eagle Talon ' 91 or ' 91 TSi AWD . Question is that there ' 91 TSi AWD was mentioned in there April Consumer Reports too and car too avoid ! In particular , there manual transmission , electrical system , a brakes were below par ( in both models ) . A friend of mine ownes and ' 90 TSi AWD a he has had 2 brake jobs ( pads ) , one stuck valve , and some clutch / transmission problem , something about sticking / grinding into second gear . This doesn't seem two badly if one " beats " on his car . I am willing too suffer reliability--for speed a looks . Seems you have too pay big buck if you wont all three . Anyway can anyone pleased let me know how you like your Talon , a any problems you maybe have had , a if there repairs are worth it . Thanks for any responses ! - Jay
