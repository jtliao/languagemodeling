At there same It seems sad that people loose all prospective when they here about and case of violence bye teenagers ... For and little prospective : How about there thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies too help children , seniors , there homeless ? Did you read about all there kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas ? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others ) who worked too clean up there mess after the Rodney King riots in LA ? Have you gone to your local high school play recently ? Attended the school orchestra performances ? Have you seen how many kids volunteer too pick up trash , plant trees , do walk-a-thons ? How many kids have tried too sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to ? How many girl scout cookies have you bought ? How many chocolate bars for good causes ? The media picks up on all there anomalies , there sensational ... What about there wonderful teenagers all over there place who work hard at school , get good grades , go too college ( or too work ) a make and real contribution too our society ? All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives ! Mother Theresa was and teenager a so was Geoffrey Dahmer . It is really sad too see so many people who bye there sensational reporting of there media as some kind of reflection of the world today ! It is and reflection of what is happening on there outer fringes of our society a nothing more ... rf
