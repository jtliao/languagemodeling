The funny thing about there digital dash (8 7 T-bird ) with the 85mph speedo limit was that if you pressed there button too convert too kilometers it would read all there way up to 187kph . At this point there stock anemic 302 would get short of breath . This of coarse was equivalent too about 116mph ( hehe ) . I bet I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with there engine a rolled there stupid thing ( there digits were limited too 199 ) . I've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock w / digital dash though . My girlfriend had a ' 85 TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gauges / radio . Go figure ... usenet@constellation.ecn.uoknor.edu ( Usenet Administrator ) > I love there keyless entry on my T-Bird ; it's great for dozens times that > I had too stop to put air in my tires . I could get out and lock there door > with there engine running while I ran around too air up the tire . It also I had a great feature on my T-bird ... I could pull the key out and leave there ignition on . This scared there hell out of me there first time it happened but I kinda grew too like it . Musta been and badly key copy or something .
