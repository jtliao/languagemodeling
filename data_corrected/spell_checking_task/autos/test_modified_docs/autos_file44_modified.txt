Can anyone post how long they are waiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told they'll have to wait ? ? " Ordered mine December 30 , got it nine weeks later . But the dealer said that * knew * orders were being held up - - he didn't expect to see any more 3.5 L-engine LHs for awhile . - = - Andrew Klossner ( andrew@frip.wv.tek.com )
