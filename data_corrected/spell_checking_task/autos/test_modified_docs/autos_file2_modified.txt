It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4 - speed with The 5 speed is much more fun .

I don't mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be and problem .

( or at least I assume there one I had was the one I read about :-) . In any case what happened was there weld between the muffler a there pipe feeding it ( ok , so I'm not and mechanic ) broke . In my case there dealer welded it , ordered replacement parts a put them on when they got them . I suspect this is some sort of 1 ) design flaw , or 2 ) production flaw . In any case I have and earlier model and would expect it too be worked out on newer ones . In any case it is and warrantee repair .

But I seriously > feel there car design is sound , a expect it too do very well . I second this . There seems too be some things that slipped through but there car seems very sound .
