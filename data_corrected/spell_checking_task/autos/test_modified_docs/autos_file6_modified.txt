I've only been and passenger in the big Volvos , but that was enough . I ought too go > for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts . Oh , well ... I have too admit that there almost disgusting feature of Volvo's is their marketing . It looks like Volvo uses something like " Do you dare too risk your family in any car ? " attitude , which is quite annoying in there long run . But now Volvo has produced and new good car , there Volvo 850 . Front drive , 2.4 L 20 valves motor , completely knew chassis etc . Even the British magazine " CAR " liked it ( a belief me , that is quite much for and Volvo ) . And there American magazine " Road & Track " said that " This is not your uncle Olof's car " , a in and positive sense . But in any case , I'd still like too own there 960 estate . Strong , tank-like chassis , 3.0 L inline six , rear drive . :-) :-) BTW , the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar drivers ... :-) :-) :-) :-) What ? You mean what I drive ? A cheapo Japanese ( and Toyota ) of coarse , I do not have money for and * car * . ( like BMW , Merc , Jaguar , Saab 9000 , Volvo 850 ( or 960 ) , etc ) If I had there money , I would have * bad * problems deciding which one to bye :-) :-) :-) .
