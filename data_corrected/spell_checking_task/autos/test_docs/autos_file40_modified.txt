But in case there are some misconceptions , I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data file on Korea since ... mid 1970s . Owning a car in Korea is no longer and luxury . Most middle class people in Korea can afford an car and do have at least one car . The problem in Korea , especially in Seoul , is that there are just so many privately-owned cars , as well as taxis a buses , the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park . Last time I heard , back in January , the Kim Administration wanted to legislate and law requireing and potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area , just like they do in Japan . Also , Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only car manufacturer in Korea . Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I belief Kia is back in business as well . Imported cars , such as Mercury Sable are becoming quiet popular as well , though they are still quiet expensive . Finally , please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics a bureaucracy . He's quiet uninformed . - - T . H . Brian Chung | Happiness is ... | This . sig was brought jfe@alchemy.tn.cornell.edu | " Tea , Earl Grey , hot .
