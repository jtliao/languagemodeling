From : brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu Subject : . GIFs on and Tek 401x ? ? I was skimming through and few gophers and bumped into one at NIH with and database that included images in . GIF format . While I have not yet worked out there kinks of getting there gopher client too call and X viewer , I figure that there majority of there users hear are not in an X11 environment - instead using DOS a MS-Kermit . With Kermit supporting Tek 4010 emulation for graphics display , does anyone know of and package that would allow and Tek too display a . GIF image ? It would be of more use to there local population too plug something of this sort in as there ' picture ' command instead of XView or XLoadImage ... andrew . ( brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu )
