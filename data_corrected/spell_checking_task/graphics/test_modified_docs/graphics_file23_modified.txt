PRJ file ? > Sorry ... Don't have anything on that or the CEL format . Well , I dived in feet first a reverse engineered there . PRJ file as much as I needed to - extracted there mapping icon information - which is when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs . I need a mapping icon per applied texture . I wont too use and special purpose graphics computer for rendering there 3DS models and it requires and texture rule / plane too be specified in 3Space , i . e . position / orientation of there mapping rule . Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply textures too ALL objects / faces , it renders ( no pun intended ) 3DS totally unsuitable for my needs . Anyone got and contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for and PC ? I must be able too specify texture rules ( one per texture ) a this must be saved in a file which I can read . I haven't founded any info on Alias in there copy of the faq that I have . Rych
