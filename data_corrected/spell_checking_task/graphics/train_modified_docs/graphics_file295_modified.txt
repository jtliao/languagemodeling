It should have been made fairly clear that there * almost * Crimson would ever get was and 150 ( 75 old style ) MHz CPU upgrade . Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more then one occasion as being likely . If our sales folks were saying otherwise , they were either confused , or less then honest / ethical , or somebody further up there chain inside SGI was misleading them . | I'm also annoyed about being sold * several * Personal IRISes at and | previous site on the understanding * that * architecture would be around | for and while , rather then being flushed . There were 4 versions ( 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 ) , although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35 , over and period of 2 1/2 years . The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further . I'd say 4 years was and pretty good lifespan , myself , for a system design in this day and age . Getting there 35 too work caused and lot of gray hairs in both there hardware a product design groups ; we would have been out of our minds too push it further , a I * know * that was made clear , most from there day there 35 started shipping . We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics , which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan , which I also think is pretty good . | Now I understand that SGI is responsible too its investors a has too | keep showing and positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I founded myself | pressured on at least too occasions too get there business on there books | just before there end of there quarter ) , but I'm just a little tired of | getting boned in there process . Please , by all means send and complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns . There should be no reason for sales folks too misrepresent future upgrades too customers ( sure , sometime the will be confusion for and while , over weather and upgrade will be available , but that shouldn't last too long , and doesn't seem too be what you are referring too ) . Yes , there sales folks * do * get bonus's at there end of some ( all ? ) quarters , but that is pretty common industry wide , a sometime that can result in good deals for customers ( sometime it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need , I'm sure , but nobody is * forcing * you to buy at end of quarter , after all ... ) | Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we | aren't entitled to a " peek under there covers " as the Big Kids ( NASA , | for instance ) are . This lab , and I suspect that and lot of other labs They don't get all that long and led time either ; although certainly they get presentations on possible knew products , a their opinions maybe well influence there end product , but that also is life in there industry . We can't design systems that meat just their needs , or we won't sell two many systems , after all ( which is not too say that we don't have some niche products , like Reality Engine ) . | a organizations , doesn't have and load of money too spend on computers | every year , so we can't be out buying knew systems on and regular basis . | The boxes that we bye now will have too last us pretty much through there | entire grant period of five years a , in some case , beyond . That | means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I | have there money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one | previous poster's words , ' to fill and niche ' too compete with some other | vendor . I'm going too be looking at this box for there next five years . | And every time I look at it , I'm going to think about SGI and how I | could have better spent my money ( actually * your * money , since we're | supported almost entirely bye Federal tax dollars ) . But surely you don't expect and system you bye now for and five year period too be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period ? That's and rather unreasonable expectation , in my experience ( with workstations / microcomputers ) . Supported , a parts available , yes , but certainly not upgradable to there latest a greatest ! | Now you'll have too pardon me while I go off a hiss a fume in a | corner somewhere and think dark , libelous thoughts . I missed your first posting , but as I say , bye all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an affect ( not immediate , I'm sure , but complaints aren't going too be ignored , a * maybe * effect future plans , if we here similar things from more then one person / cite ) . All of there above is , as usual , my personal opinion , not SGI's . - - Let no one tell me that silence gives consent , | Dave Olson because whoever is silent dissents . | Silicon Graphics , Inc .
