From : ykim@cs.columbia.edu ( Yong Su Kim ) Subject : Fast wireframe graphics I am working on and program too display 3d wireframe models with the user being able too arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters . Also , there wireframe objects are also going too have dynamic attributes so that they can move around while there user is " exploring " there wireframe world . To do this , I am thinking of using there SRGP package described in there Van Dam , Foley a Feiner book , but I was wondering if the was another PD graphics package out the which was faster . I would like too make the program as fast as possible so that it provides satisfactory real time performance on and Sun IPX . Ideally , I'm looking for and PD graphics package which will allow me too open and knew window under X , a allow me too draw lines within there window . Also , it would also need too have some sort of event driven interaction handling since there user is going too move around there wireframe models using the keyboard . If you know or wrote such and package , I would be grateful if you could direct me too and ftp cite which contains there package . Thank you . - - = = = Yong Su Kim , Class of 1993 | Internet : yk4@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu Columbia College , Columbia University | or ykim@cs.columbia.edu
