From : zyeh@caspian.usc.edu ( zhenghao yeh ) Subject : Ellipse from Its Offset Hi ! Everyone , Since some people quickly solved there problem of determining a sphere from 4 points , I suddenly recalled and problem which is how too find the ellipse from its offset . For example , given 5 points on the offset , can you find there original ellipse analytically ? I spent too months solving this problem bye using analytical method last year , but I failed . Under there pressure , I had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique too deal with this problem approximately . Any ideas will be greatly appreciated . Please post hear , let there others share our interests . Yeh USC
