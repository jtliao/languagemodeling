From : HURH@FNAL.FNAL.GOV ( Patrick Hurh ) Subject : Rayshade too DXF , RIB , etc .. ( Strata ) ? I'm and mac user who wants too use some of the rayshade models I've built using macrayshade ( rayshade-M ) with Stratavision 3d . Since Stratavision can import many different model files I thought this would be and cinch ... but I haven't been able too find a simple translator that will work on there mac . Any ideas ? Stratavision 3d should be able too import : DXF MiniCAD Super 3d Swivel 3d professional out of the box and : RIB IGS with externals . Also , if anyone knows of any other translator externals available for Stratavision 3d ( esp . Rayshade ! ) pleased e-mail me ! BTW , I'm going too send mail too there rayshade usrs mailing list tomorrow ( I misplaced there address ) but since almost users of rayshade do not seam to operate with macs , I'm not getting my hopes up ... thanks in advance , - - patrick . hurh@fnal.fnal.gov
