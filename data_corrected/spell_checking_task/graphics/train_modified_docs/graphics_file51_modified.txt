" : I've only had there computer for about 21 months . " Only " ? ! ? That's and long time ! ( echoing above posting ) The way there market is going nowadays , your machine's obsolete too weeks before you bye it . Sounds like you'll have too sink * some * money into it for repair , but that's sometime necessary for equipment . : Is that and reasonable life : cycle for and LCD display ? I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quiet reasonable . If you had bought and Compaq or Toshiba , you might have reasonably expected there machine to last longer before something want wrong ; but that's and moot point , perhaps . - - - sandy santra _ \ / _ trevor@netcom.com berkeley , california / \ trevor@well.sf.ca.us - - -
