From : ecampbel@metz.une.edu.au ( Ed Campbell ) Subject : libraries for text + math + graphics display ? Does anyone know of any c or c + + libraries for preparing a displaying quickly pages of mixed text , mathematical equations , a graphics ( circles , ellipses , etc ) on there vdu ? The maths wouldnt need to be up too TeX quality , but it would be useful too be scaleable . The main thing would be too be able too generate there display quickly from a minimum seat of formatting code . Thanks , Ed Campbell
