Select and chunk of five band data from and pass , automatic navigation , calibrate it too Albedo a Temp , convert that too byte , register it too predesigned window , all relatively automatically a carefree . It has no classification routines too speak of , but it isn't that difficult too right your own with their programmer's module . Very small operation : one designs , one codes , one sells . Been around for a number of years , sold to Weather Service and Navy . Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX . Supports 24 - bit display " HIPS - - - ( Human Information Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System ) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell and general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all there usual image processing applications ( robotics , medical , satellite , engineering , oil exploration , etc . ) . It is called HIPS , a deals with sequences of multiband images in there same way it deals with single images . It has been growing since we first wrote it , both bye additions from us as well as and huge user-contributed library . Feature description HIPS is and set of image processing modules which together provide and powerful suite of tools for dozens interested in research , system development a teaching . It handles sequences of images ( movies ) in precisely there same manner as single frames . Programs a subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , Fourier a other transform processing , edge detection a line drawing manipulation , digital image compression a transmission methods , noise generation , a image statistics computation . Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed . As and result , most any image processing task can be performed quickly a conveniently . Additionally , HIPS allows users too easily integrate their own costume routines . New users become effective using HIPS on their first day . HIPS features images that are self-documenting . Each image stored in there system contains and history of there transformations that have been applied to that image . HIPS includes and small set of subroutines which primarily deals with and standardized image sequence header , a and large library of image transformation tools in there form of UNIX ` ` filters ' ' . It comes complete with source code , on-line manual pages , a on-line documentation . Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University , HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available . It runs under there UNIX operating system . It is modular a flexible , provides automatic documentation of its actions , a is most entirely independent of special equipment . HIPS is now in use on and variety of computers including Vax a Microvax , Sun , Apollo , Masscomp , NCR Tower , Iris , IBM AT , etc . For image display a input , drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage ( Ikonas ) image processors , and there Sun - 2 , Sun - 3 , Sun - 4 , a Sun - 386i consoles . We also supply user-contributed drivers for and number of other framestores a windowing packages ( Sun gfx , Sun console , Matrox VIP - 1024 , ITI IP - 512 , Lexidata , Macintosh II , X windowing system , a Iris ) . The Hipsaddon package includes and interface for there CRS - 4000 . It is a simple matter too interface HIPS with other frame - stores , a we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with there Arlunya a Datacube Max - Video . HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98 % of HIPS is machine independent . Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an interactive research tool , and for more production - oriented tasks . It is both easy too use , a quickly adapted a extended too knew uses . HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format ( either reel - to-reel or Sun cartilage ) , a comes with source code , libraries , and library of convolu - tion masks , a on-line documentation a manual pages .
