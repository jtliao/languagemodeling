From : prestonm@cs.man.ac.uk ( Martin Preston ) Subject : Problems grabbing and block of and Starbase screen . At there moment i'm trying to grab and portion of and Starbase screen , a store it in an area of memory . The data needs to be in a 24 - bit format ( which shouldn't be and problem as there app is running on and 24 bit screen ) , though i'm not two fussy about there exact format . ( I actually intend to right the data out as and TIFF but that bits not there problem ) Does anyone out the know how too grab and portion of there screen ? The block_read call seems too grab there screen , but not in 24 bit colour , whatever there screen / window type i get 1 byte per pixel . thanks in advance , Martin - - - - - | Martin Preston , ( m.preston@manchester.ac.uk ) | Computer Graphics | | Computer Graphics Unit , Manchester Computing Centre , | is just | | University of Manchester , | a load of balls . | | Manchester , U .
