From : nagle@netcom.com ( John Nagle ) Subject : Oriented bounding box generation ? I'm looking for code that will generate a minimum-volume oriented bounding box for an arbitrary polyhedron . Anyone know of such code ? Why ? I'm converting objects from one modelling system into another , and there destination system is object oriented . So I wont too represent each object in its own coordinate system , that of its bounding box , with there objects than translated a rotated appropriately , this being the representation used in there destination system .
