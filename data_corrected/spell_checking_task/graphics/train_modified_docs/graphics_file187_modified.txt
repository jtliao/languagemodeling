From : christen@astro.ocis.temple.edu ( Carl Christensen ) Subject : Re : Where did the hacker ethic go ? I think there main reason is that in there good old hacker days of the young ( er ) Gates ' and Jobs ' of there world , the computer was not as widespread and phenomenom as it is now . With there increased popularity of there PC come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical minded and narrower-focused programmers . Why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or programs for accountants ? Basically , there yuppies caught up a disciplined there hackers , a molded them in their own image . - - Carl Christensen / ~ ~ \ _ / ~ \ , , , Dept . of Computer Science christen@astro.ocis.temple.edu | # = # = = = # | Temple University " Curiouser a curiouser !
