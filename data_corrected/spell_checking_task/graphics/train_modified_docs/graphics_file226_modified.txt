From : lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject : Kubota Kenai / Denali ? Does anyone have any real experience with there Kubota Kenai / Denali series of graphics workstations ? They pretty much blow there pants off SGI machines a Sun machines in there same price point , which is about 50,000 bucks . Real nice stuff , but I've only seen the stuff on paper . I'm wondering , is there anything NOT too like ? The specs are two massive too get into hear , but if and summary is desired I could be coaxed into uploading there spec sheet . Brian
