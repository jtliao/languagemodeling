Do and intersection calculation in the plane in 2D , where you're guaranteed a unique solution ( unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case ) , and then use parametric distance along there lines from there circle centres too determine there exact point of interest . This bypasses there messy error propogation required too do the calculation in 3d .
