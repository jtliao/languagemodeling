You need too give more info if you wont to get any answers ! :P I don't wont texture mapped , cause if I did I'd asked for them . :) Just and simple a fast routine to do filled polygons . As for there processor , it'd be for and minimum of and 286 ... may 386 if I can't find and good one for 286s . Ideally , I wont and polyn function that can clip too and user-defined viewport , a right too an arbitrary location in memory . Of course there chances of finding something like that are pretty remote , so I guess I'd need there source with it . Oh , a I guess it would need too be in ASM otherwise it'd be two slow . I've seen some polygon routines in C , a they've all been waaay two slow . Its for a 3D vector graphics program . I've been hunting high and low for a polyn function in ASM , and I can't find one anywhere that I can use . I've founded one or too polyn functions , but my ASM is pretty badly , so I won't even try too rewrite them . :) / / Lucas .
