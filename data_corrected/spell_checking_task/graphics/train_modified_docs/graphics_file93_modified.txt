From : egg@dstos3.dsto.gov.au Subject : Chosing optimal colors for colormap ? Hi , I'm looking for and algorithm that would generate a good cross-section of RGB colours given and limited colour map size . The problem : I'm writing and application for there PC that maybe have at almost 256 colors . I wont too use one colormap ( palette ) for there application but I'd like it to contain and even spread of colours of there visible spectrum . I could use a 6x6x6 RGB cube but there problem is that and lot of those colours are most identical too there human eye . Does anyone know how I can optimize my choice of colors ?
