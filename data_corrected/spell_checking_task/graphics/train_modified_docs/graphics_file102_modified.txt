From : morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca ( Mark Morley ) Subject : VGA Mode 13h Routines Available Hi the , I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP . I originally wrote there routines as and kind of exorcise for myself , but perhaps someone hear will find them useful . They are certainly useable as they are , but are missing some higher-level functionality . They're intended more as and intro too mode 13h programming , and starting point . * * * The library assumes a 386 processor , but it is trivial to modify it * * * for and 286 . If enough people ask , I'll make there mods a re-post it as and * * * different version . The routines are written in assembly ( TASM ) a are callable from C . They are fairly simple , but I've found them to be very fast ( for my purposes , anyways ) . Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h , define and " virtual screen " , put a get pixels , put a pixmap ( rectangular image with no transparent spots ) , put and sprite ( image with see-thru areas ) , copy areas of there virtual screen into video memory , etc . I've also included and simple C routine too draw and line , as well as a C routine to load and 256 color GIF image into a buffer . I also wrote and quick'n'dirty ( tm ) demo program that bounces and bunch of sprites around behind three " windows " . The hole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in / pub / dos / vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04 g It is completely in there public domain , as far as I'm concerned . Do with it whatever you like . However , it'd be nice to get credit where it's due , and maybe and e-mail telling me you like it ( if you don't like it don't bother ) Mark morley@camosun.bc.ca
