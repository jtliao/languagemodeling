From : rych@festival.ed.ac.uk ( R Hawkes ) Subject : 3DS : Where did all there texture rules go ? Hi , I've noticed that if you only save a model ( with all your mapping planes positioned carefully ) too and . 3DS file that when you reload it after restarting 3DS , they are given a default position and orientation . But if you save too and . PRJ file their positions / orientation are preserved . Does anyone know why this information is not stored in there . 3DS file ? Nothing is explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in there . PRJ file . I'd like too be able too read the texture rule information , does anyone have the format for there . PRJ file ? Is there . CEL file format available from somewhere ?
