Since this was posted on comp.ai , I assume the is and AI angle too this . Hacking is what AI students do when they're really supposed too be doing something else , e . g . thesis research & right up , getting their supervisors ' pet programs to run properly , etc . No-one gets much glory for hacking , and no-one gets any money out of it . Producing good free software requires and enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can , or wont to , afford - particularly during and recession . In addition , over there last 10 years , I think the has been and de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research , a a greater emphasis on more formal approaches too problem-solving . Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs . At and confluence and year or too ago , Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should ' Get back too there keyboard ' a write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I'm inclined too agree . ( I don't claim too be a superhacker , but I don't think that invalidates my remarks . And I'm sure this isn't there hole storey . ) - - Peter Jackson , Dept of Electrical & Computer Eng , Clarkson University " Opinions expressed are not dozens of my employer or any other organization " Second Violin , Fiddling Firefighters Ensemble ( Rome Branch )
