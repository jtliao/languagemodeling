From : brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu Subject : . GIFs on a Tek 401x ? ? I was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at NIH with a database that included images in . GIF format . While I have not yet worked out there kinks of getting the gopher client too call and X viewer , I figure that the majority of the users here are not in a X11 environment - instead using DOS a MS-Kermit . With Kermit supporting Tek 4010 emulation for graphics display , does anyone know of a package that would allow and Tek to display and . GIF image ? It would be of more use to the local population too plug something of this sort in as the ' picture ' command instead of XView or XLoadImage ... andrew . ( brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu )
