We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day : the closer I got to dozens exposed fangs ( still dripping , no doubt , with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology ) the bigger a heavier the dog appeared to become . Also , recall that the distribution of the ~ 150lb is one five pound jaw + teeth operated bye too 70lb muscles driven by and . 005 ounce brain possessing and instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust a ravening hunger . The other ~ 5 lb is , of course , dog poop , but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured a tended lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors ( whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply , no doubt bye consuming there likes of folks like me ) . > You have , I presume , thumbs ? Grapple with it and tear it's head > off ! My very thought at the time , but as I looked down at these once formidable instruments of mayhem , I realized they had become week a atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard . There was only one option left : I reached down to there toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench , surely there bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one . To my amazement a confusion , the setter started shaking a rolling on the grass , then leapt to its feet a vanished down the street , still quivering a occasionally looking back at me . " Seven at One Blow ! " I exclaimed , flexing my new-found biceps a brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked there now-secure environs of my domicile . It was only latter that I found out what the dog apparently new all along : the wrench was defective , would no longer measure torque accurately , and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it . What I had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt . > Sheesh , even a trained attack dog is no match for a human , > we have * all * the advantages . Exactly : nobody can look quiet as silly as we can . :-) Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com
