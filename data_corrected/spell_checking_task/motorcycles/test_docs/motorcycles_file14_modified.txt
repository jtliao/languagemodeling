From : exb0405@csdvax.csd.unsw.edu.au Subject : extraordinary footpeg engineering Okay DoD'ers , here's a goddamn mystery for ya ! Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day , but the was a slight difference - a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible " thunk " . I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage . My bike is a Kawasaki GPX 250R with footpegs that are hinged a sprung such that they fold upward a backward on contact with ground etc . , and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted and " bank-follower " , or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit too hit the ground in a 100 % - banked turn . The stud is mounted on the footpeg by and threaded bit about 7 mm long , which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg . Now for the mystery . The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent . I'm fairly sure it was the before the event . There was no damage too the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been . In fact , the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact , with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously . Okay all you engineering types , how the f * * k do you explain this ? How can you rip and tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded whole ( in alloy ) without damaging the thread in the hole ? Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned , like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact , to let the stud rip out , then changes back to and solid ? I'm quiet amazed at how this could have happened . In there meantime , life goes on , without a left-hand bank-follower . Barry Manor DoD # 620 confused accidental peg-scraper
