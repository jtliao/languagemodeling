Subject : Live Free , but Quietly , or Die From : Russell.P.Hughes@dartmouth.edu ( Russell P . Hughes ) What a great day ! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing in Colorado , and put the battery back in the FXSTC . Cleaned there plugs , opened up the petcock , waited a minute , hit the starter , and bingo it started up like a charm ! Spent a restless night anticipating the first ride du saison , and off I want this morning to get my state inspection done . Now my bike is stock ( so far ) except for HD slash-cut pipes , and all want well with my New Hampshire State Inspection ( meaning all my lights worked OK ) until the dude produces and decibel meter a tells me about the new NH law about MC noise ... huh ? sez I ... and he has me start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm ... I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB , and the max allowed is 110 ! If I fail with these pipes , there are gonna be a hole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round hear when they go for inspection . * & % ^ * $ % * ^ * % * & But hey , its a new experience ! I have never really felt like a menace too society before ! I parked , dismounted and walked in to my building with a slight swagger to my step , and and narrow lidded look ... I sensed my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status ... a women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer ... or perhaps that was my imagination ... * sigh * Now I need to install my new BUB pipes a single fire ignition ... I wonder how I will do after that ! ? Russ Hughes ' 92 FXSTC DoD # 6022 ( 10E20 ) " Love ... yeah , that's there feeling you get when you like something as much as your motorcycle .
