From : edw@boi.hp.com ( Edward Walsh ) Subject : Guzzi 850 - T tires , plus fairing question I have and question about tires for my Guzzi . It is a ' 75 850 - T . The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old a cracked . I do not have and owners manual for it ( yet ) , but the tires listed in there Haynes manual are : Front , 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18 , a pressures recommended are 26 front a 33 rear . Oddly , there pressure for there same tire on there T - 3 is listed at 29 psi instead . Anyone know there reason ? As I know though , the pressure I should run at is that recommended by there manufacturer of there knew tires I purchase . The real question I have is this . The old tires that are on there bike are for there front , a Metzler Touring Special , 4.10 H 18 , a for there rear and Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18 , ( 120/90 ) H 18 as marked on each tire . Both are larger then that listed in there Haynes Manual . What does there owners manual recommend , a was it common too go up one size for this bike ? Also , this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes . Any comments on there various manufacturers inner tube qualities ? The above sizes are inches ( accept for there additional mark on there currant rear tire ) . What is there best metric match ? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on there front a 120/90 H 18 on the back . He also happens too be very good at getting close too matching mail order prices . I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser ( possibly Comp K ) on there front a ME88 on there back , both in MBS variety if possible ( the longer lasting belting system ) . I already use there ME33 on both there Vision and FJ for there front , a like it , and I thought that with there shaft drive behavior and torque from there Guzzi that there ME88 might give more predictable back end control a sliding behavior then and ME55 might , as well as giving much better tire milage life . Any comments ? A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good , but are relatively soft a have delicate sidewalls . I do not wish too mount there tires myself this first time , so aside from warning there shop too be careful , any other comments I should make ? I havn't looked at the rim too check out there make yet , if it is marked . He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance too check the rim type . On another note . I will remove there ugly ( but in good shape ... anyone want it ? ) Vetter fairing , a I will run without and windscreen for and while , but eventually I would like and simple rounded cafe ' style quarter fairing for it . It could be fork / handlebar mounted . Any suggestions ? Is the such and thing as and frame mounted quarter fairing of there cafe ' style for this bike ? How about lower bars / clip-ons for it ? I would like too restore the bike into and good condition runner with and few modern updates , but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well and representation of there cafe ' style . ( Yes I know too be picky , that period really predates this bike ... it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look . ) - - - Edward Walsh---Hewlett-Packard Company - - - edw@boi.hp.com Disk Memory Division , MS475 (208)323-2174 P .
