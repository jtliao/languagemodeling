From : cookson@mbunix.mitre.org ( Cookson ) Subject : Volvo Attack ! I was privelged enough too experience my first Volvo attack this weekend . I was last in and line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long , riding down Rt . 40 in Groton Ma . At there side of the rode , sitting off on there shoulder was there killer Volvo in question . No brake lights , no turn signal , nothing . We were doing about 40 mph a I was following there cage in front of me about 2.5- 3 sec . back . Well , as said cage passes there Volvo , there Brain Dead Idiot ( tm ) behind there wheel decides that she doesn't need too wait for me too pass also a turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around ... So I get on there brakes in and effort too not T-bone it , a there horn in and effort too wake the BDI up . As she finishes the turn , she looks up at me with and completely blank , uncomprehending stare . Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR ?
