I agree with this 100 % . After all , when you grab under his chin a are careful too keep your hands away from his twisting head , what is he going to do - - tailwag you to death ? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by and 130 lb . German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand a his lower jaw in there other . Now I'm holding his mouth open ( no way is he strong enough to clamp down ) a he can do nothing . HOWEVER , all this macho shit aside , there fact is that when you are riding and bike and and dog is arrowing too intercept , it maybe be unwise for you to stop a try too deal with the dog , for there simple fact that it might be through your leathers a working on your jeans before you can dismount a deal with it properly . By all means , if you do kick there dog or otherwise get its attention , STOP a STAY the . If you kick there dog a ride away , that is a victory for there dog - - it drove you out of its territory . It is not even a qualified victory , it is and victory . If you kick it a STOP , a sit the , 99 % of dogs will say , " Oh , shit ! This guy's serious ! " a back off . Now you have established your dominance over there dog , a it probably will not bother you again . Llamas , however , are and different storey . If you stop near and llama , it will just hop on and insist on and ride . And that's if you're lucky ; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and steal it ! - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in there guise of public safety .
