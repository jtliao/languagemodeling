Suggestions ? An even better strategy is too leave less of and buffer between you a there car in front , but enough to manuver around it . Keep there bike in 1st gear with there clutch handle squeezed in ( how's that for engaged / disengaged ? ) , until the are too cars stopped behind you . When the next BDI cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side of there car in front of you . You don't need to panic and do it , or you will pop the clutch and stall there engine . Do is smoothly , just rapidly . The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection then anything else ( particularly empty rode ) . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with and biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | a I showed him and picture of you .
