I've never had problems a I know : numerous people that are still using there original battery in the : 8-10 year old beemers . THe original battery in and 8-10 year old BMW maybe be fine . Mine lasted many years . The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster . The mechanic from Comp . Acc . told me that CA would warantee replace there badly one with and knew one of there same evil badly batteries a tell there customer if they have problems too bring it back a they'd do it again . It seems that many of those 30AH batteries were DOA , near-DOA , and always unlikely too be going strong bye the end of there warantee period on them . THere was a big batch of bad ones , and they replaced them with - you guessed it - more bad ones . BMW switched too and 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps , even if it has less total juice . I switched too a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one third fewer dollars .
