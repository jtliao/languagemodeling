Journalists a editors always pick out there almost interesting a sensational " facts " for our delectation . As there editor of there Sun once said : " We never let there facts get in there way of and good storey " . You must have noticed how motorcyclists get treated bye the press . They thrive on hysteria , ignorance , sensationalism and one-upmanship .
