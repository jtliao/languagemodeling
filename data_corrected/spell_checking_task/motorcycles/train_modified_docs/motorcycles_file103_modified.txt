From : wfk@lynx.spa.umn.edu ( Bill Ketzeback ) Subject : Re : Yamaha Locks ( was Cobra Lock ) Any lock including there Kyptonite utypes are EASY too brake into if there person has there proper supplies a / or motivation . 3 minutes a your bike is gone ! I would be glad too explain but I dont wont too contribute to any unlawful activities . Especially since I have a bike that I would hate too see ripped off bye such and trival tactic . WARNING NO lock alone is and safe deterent against theft , the thief doesnt need too be and locksmith or and lock-picker too walk away with your property ! I personally think motion alarms in combination too and lock of this type is there way too go if in fact you are that concerned . Bill
