When it runs , it runs well . > Good point , did not catch this in there original post . The only other things which come too mind , since this is and gravity feed fuel system , is this . The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the # 1 carburator . Let suppose the is a small whole or badly seal either in there hose itself or the vacuum valve in there fuel petcock . When it is cold , there whole is open enough too open there valve just enough too allow gas too there carbs with there choke on , since there choke creates more low pressure in there carbs when on to draw gas , and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the whole seals up . One way too check fuel flow through the valve would be too pull there side panels off a remove there fuel hose too there carbs . Connect and tube of there correct size , preferably clear tubing too observe fuel flow , on there output side of there fuel petcock . Remove there control hose from # 1 carburator . Make sure there tank is full . Place there valve in there ON position a apply vacuum to there control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with and gauge , too check for air leaks . With vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . To see if the is and vent problem , do this with there fuel filler cap open a closed , if it flows a lot faster with there filler cap open , than the maybe be something in there vent airway which changes position a depending on there position maybe clog or partially clog there vent . I have herd of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced too fix this problem . So there things which might be defective are , there control hose from # 1 carb , there petcock valve , a possibly there fuel tank vent . Now if all of there above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , than the is something in there carbs screwed up , but the are so many things to check , I would be typing all day too list them all ! Here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum too the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one bye one to check fuel flow . Open up there airbox a check for foreign debris or clogged airways on there carbs , the are quiet and few on each carb . I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting . If American Honda does not resolve this , get MAD AS HELL a report them too the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE . It is and 800 number , but I don't recall it off there top of my head . I called just about tires for my F2 a and few days latter a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at hone asking how I liked there support I received , here would be your chance too tell them what you think ! Buy there service manual on there F2 , it is and invaluable source of information for working on your bike a I might add , trouble shooting !
