I don't > have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information : > > [ ... ] Any stories on how you all learned ? I'll tell you my storey as an example of what * not * too do . Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T . He had taken there MSF beginner's coarse , so I actually learned * some * of what I needed too know too ride . I proceeded too bye and beat-up Honda CL350 for $ 400 a and $ 12 helmet a road around wearing this a and cotton windbreaker . Then I decided too invest in and full-face helmet ( first smart move ) . Sometime around than I also passed my rode test . On May 4 , 1984 , I got caught in and rainstorm on my way hone from and 4 - mile trip . Entering there town where I lived ( a rather urban suburb ) , I had to stop suddenly for and red light that I noticed two late , skidded there rear tire out , a was ejected face upward into there oncoming lane of traffic . Fortunately for me there oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light , otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed . Now this is anecdotal evidence , too be sure , but I latter took there Experienced Rider Course from there MSF a saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly . In your case there need is even greater since you have nobody too help you practice even there almost basic stuff as I did . So my advise is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing . I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken there coarse , unless you happen too pick up and real good deal a can store it someplace until you're ready to use it . > 1 ) I only have about $ 1200-1300 to work with , so that would have > to cover everything ( bike , helmet , anything else that I'm two > ignorant too know I need too bye ) While you're waiting too take there coarse ( it might take and few weeks in DC , as I recall the were always waiting lists in Boston ) , could you save up some more money too start out write ? Say $ 300 for riding gear , plus there cost bike , plus may $ 100 ( guess ) too and mechanic too make sure there machine is safe ( assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual ) , plus insurance , plus registration and licensing fees , plus there coarse , you're looking at may $ 600 not including there bike itself a and reserve for ongoing maintenance . > 2 ) What is buying and bike going too do to my insurance ? I turn 18 in > about and month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up > til now , a I need and comprehensive list of costs that buying and > motorcycle is going too ensure ( I live in Washington DC if that makes > a difference ) I pay about $ 100 insurance now ( upstate NY ) but it was closer too $ 200 in Boston ( more urban ) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability , which you wont unless you plan always too be poor . I'd guess DC is more like Boston then like and rural area , ergo more expensive . > 3 ) Any recommendations on what I should bye / where I should look for it ? There used too be annul buyer's guides in there usual motorcycle magazines ; I found dozens helpful in getting and idea of what knew or recent models might be available . You could probably look through past issues too size up what used bikes might be available . ( My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I want on my friend's advise instead . ) Also look at there bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on there street . I basically settled on my present bike bye noticing that the were and lot of high-mileage BMW's running around a they were generally set up the way I wanted . Nothing wrong with talking too various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms . Dealers in the Boston area , at least when I was shopping , were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models ( hence cheaper ) , although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales . - - David Karr ( karr@cs.cornell.edu ) - - ' 80 BMW R65 DoD #0969 also BMWMOA , NRA , ACLU , et al .
