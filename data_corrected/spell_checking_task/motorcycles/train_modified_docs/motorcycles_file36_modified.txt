From : s851708@minyos.xx.rmit.OZ.AU ( John Edmond Auckett ) Subject : Re : Dogs vs . Bikes Dogs will chase anything that moves . I have two dogs and they love chasing me when I ride off . They will also chase any car that passes , running along there footpath / sidewalk at up to 60kph . They don't seem too go after trucks though , there size difference must be and factor . It also works in my favour though , I can exorcise them quiet easily bye riding 1/2 mile up there road and back a few times . JA ( s851708@minyos.rmit.oz.au )
