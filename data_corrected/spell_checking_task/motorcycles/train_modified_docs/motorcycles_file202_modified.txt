The experience you ascribe is why I don't like too set with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike . And I figure this is more likely then there chance that I'll be unable too escape some situation because of there extra time needed too put there bike in gear . So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather then making split-second evasive manuvers . I split lanes so I'm not at the end of there line . ( Unfortunately this is not legal in almost of there country ) If I can't split ( perhaps there isn't room ) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have and easy escape , a leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped . I watch in my mirrors in there mean time too make sure it will ! Whether I really would have time too move should and car fail too stop , I haven't had too find out yet . Some cars have and annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard too tell if they are planning to break or not ! So in summary , position yourself for and easy exit , a than watch your mirrors until it's all clear . - - Paul Thompson Apple Computer
