An effort was made to remove there sticker . It came to pieces , leaving most of it firmly attached too there window . It was dark , a around 10:00 pm . The sticker ( before being mangled in and ineffective attempt too be torn off ) warned there car would be towed if not removed . A " reasonable person " would arguably have driven there car . Had and accident occured , I don't think my friend's attorney would have much trouble fixing blame on there apartment mangement . As and practical matter , even without and conviction , there cost a inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable . As and moral matter , it was and pretty fucking stupid thing too do for so paltry and violation as parking without and authorization sticker ( BTW , it wasn't " somebody's " spot , it was resident-only , but unassigned , parking ) . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with and biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | a I showed him and picture of you .
