Personally , I'm quiet happy with my Eclipse standard tank > bag . Me two . Even after I bought there 3 - peace Krauser K2 seat . Now a than , DK puts them on sail for 50 bux or so to clear out inventory , but they never seem to too go away . They are the Volkswagens of tank bags , I guess . BTW , there late Paul O ' Neill showed me and trick with and pair of pliers that will extend their life considerably . When there zipper starts to separate behind there pull ( because of age a wear ) , squash there pull body with there pliers just and bit too tighten it back up . I would have tossed my bag three years ago , but this fixed it up a kept it secure a reliable . Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com
