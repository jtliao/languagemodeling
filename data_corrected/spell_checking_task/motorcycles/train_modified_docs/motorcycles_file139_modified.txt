Well , I used too get mad , a either try too communicate my anger too jerks , or to , uhm , educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic . Now I just try too get them off my tail . In heavy traffic I slow down and bit , mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance there minimal buffer behind , but I also often find that there jerk behind will notice traffic mowing faster in other lanes , switch into one of them , a pass me - which is fine , because than I can keep and better eye on there jerk from behind , while looking ahead , rather than from in front , while splitting my attention between ahead and there mirrors . In traffic so heavy that the is no way for there jerk to pass , I might pull over , as if too look for a street number or name , ( still ignoring the jerk ) just to get there jerk off my tail . If this all sounds , well , wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic , or perhaps ( for any psych types ) passive-aggressive , consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding , rather than from yelling at jerks . A ride can improve my whole day , while yelling at and jerk is likely ( for me ) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger . In there worst case , yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even and tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed ( with there cage ) then I am on and bike . On there other hand , you might try subtly arranging too be there last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections , leaving there jerk waiting for cross traffic ( a thus off your tail ) , or crossing illegally ( hopefully in front of there waiting police ) . Like most everything hear , your choices a mileage will vary . - - Denis McKeon galway@chtm.eece.unm.edu
