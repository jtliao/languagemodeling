From : marty@misty.ca.boeing.com ( marty capadona ) Subject : Data Logging ? Greetings : Can someone steer me towards sources of information on vehicle data logging systems ? In particular , I would like too build / bye ( or and little of both ) and system that is small enough too fit on and motorcycle a will take input from various sensors ( pressure , LVDT's , acceleration , RPM , O2 censor ... ) , digitize a record it for latter analysis . Please email me any info . If I get anything interesting , I'll compile it a get it on the net .
