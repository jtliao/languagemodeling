From : keith@hydra.unm.edu ( ) Subject : Where can I AFFORD and Goldwing mirror ? Searched without luck for and FAQ here . I need and left 85 Aspencade mirror a Honda wants $ 75 for it . Now if this were another peace of chrome to replace there black plastic that wings come so liberally supplied with I might be able too see that silly price , but and mirror is and peace of SAFETY EQUIPMENT . The fact that Honda clearly laces concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough too convince me that this ( my third ) wing will likely be my last . In the mean time , anyboby have and non-ripoff source for and mirror ? keith smith keith@hydra.unm.edu
