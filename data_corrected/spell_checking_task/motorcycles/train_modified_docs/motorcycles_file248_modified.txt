While shopping for and passenger helmet , I noticed that in many cases there external dimensions of there helmets were there same from S through XL . The difference was there amount of inside padding . My solution was to buy and large helmet , a construct a removable liner from and sheet of . 5 " closed-cell foam a some satin ( glued too there inside surface ) . The result is and reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with there liner in , a and comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out . Everyone else gets linered or not bye best fit . - - - - - Michael Robinson UUCP : ucbvax ! cogsci ! robinson INTERNET : robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu
