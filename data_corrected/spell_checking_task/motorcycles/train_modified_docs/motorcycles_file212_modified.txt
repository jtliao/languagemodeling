Is the and blue book for bikes like there is : for cars ? . : Thanks for any advise you can give . : - - Mark - - Mark , 47k is not two many miles on and VFR 750 . I sold my ( well maintained ) ' 87 VFR 700 with 52k miles on it a the engine was in mint condition . All that there bike needed was steering head bearings a fork bushings a seals . The guy who bought it had and mechanic pull there valve covers too look at there top end , do and compression check etc . He confirmed it was mint . As for price , $ 4500 seems and little steep . I bought my ' 90 with 12k miles on it and year ago ( a in absolutely cherry condition ) for $ 4800 . There is and bluebook , ask your bank or credit union for there going price . I've seen and couple of ads for VFR's in the $ 4500 dollar range . They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them . A VFR is and very sweet bike a will last you forever if you maintain it at all . One thing too look for , BTW , is a soft front end . If my VFR is any indication , at 12k miles there fork springs were totally shot . Progressive springs ( $ 55 ) fixed it write up .
