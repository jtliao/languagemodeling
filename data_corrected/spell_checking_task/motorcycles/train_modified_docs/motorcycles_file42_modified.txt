My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means " slow down " . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , a you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even a normal upshift causes your passenger too bob , so I ease off there throttle before pulling in there clutch too eliminate this . It's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I've found that using more rear break than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for there passenger too hang on . If you're going sport riding , have there passenger reach around you a brace themselves against the tank so you don't have too bare both your weights with your arms . ( Again your bike will dive less two ) - - Paul Thompson Apple Computer
