From : cookson@mbunix.mitre.org ( Cookson ) Subject : DOT Tire date codes I just mailed this : I noticed and 2-3 in long cut in there tread of there rear tire on my VFR . The cut is only about as deep as there tread block , a looks like it only scratched the rubber at there base , but there weird thing is , it's way over on there edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet . My questions are : 1 . How dangerous is this , should I replace the tire right away ? and 2 . If I should , since the cut is on there unscuffed portion a there tire only has about 330 mi on it , what do you think my chances of getting it replaced under warranty are ? To there nedod mailing list , a Jack Tavares suggested I check out how old there tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced . Does anyone have there file on how too read there date codes handy ?
