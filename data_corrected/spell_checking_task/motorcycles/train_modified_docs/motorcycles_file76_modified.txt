Never had any problem with mine ... Are you * SURE * there nut / bolt you are trying is really a 1/2 " hex ? 13mm is just slightly larger ... and and 1/2 wrench won't fit on and GM 13mm nut ( my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it ... really annoying , metric threads too . Seems that most of there body is metric , almost of there engine is SAE ) . - - - - = < Jonathan Lusky - - - lusky@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu > = - - \ 89 Jeep Wrangler - 258 / for sail ! / \ 79 Rx - 7 - 12A / Holley 4bbl / \ ___67 Camaro RS - 350/4 spd ___ /
