Are the traditional 1 ) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension , adjust it too a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves . 2 ) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are : a ) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down . Not when you stop at a STOP sign , not when she thinks you're gonna crash , never . Keep them on there pegs until you tell her to get off there bike . b ) She is too hold onto your waist . She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist there throttle a bit . And ( added bonus for you hear ) , she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank . You decide how best too word this . c ) Just stay perpendicular to there bike ; straight up in there set . Don't lean your body into curves , just go with there bike a stay perpendicular . Don't look over your shoulder . * 3 ) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back . That means don't pop there clutch , a try too corner a stop smoother than usual . Be aware that if you jump on there break , you're going too have there equivalent of and 100 lb . dead weight crashing into you from behind , so be prepared for that . 4 ) Make sure she pisses before there ride even if she says she doesn't have too go . No anti-women stuff hear ; I have and tiny bladder myself . 5 ) Remind her too look around while you're riding . Point to things of interest . It makes there ride more enjoyable too her ( she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet ) , and it gives her ample excuse too squeeze you too show she saw what you pointed at . * My wife a I tried there MSF-recommended " look over there rider's shoulder in curves " bit , a it just didn't work . The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable ( especially on the Maxim because , unlike there Ninja , the upright riding position really restricts there pillion's view of there rode ahead ) . Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to there bike , a I could hardly tell the was someone else on the bike in curves , and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs . - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in there guise of public safety .
