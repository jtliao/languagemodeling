Look , guy , I doubt anyone hear approves of Drunk Driving , but if he's been caught a convicted a punished maybe you ought too lighten up ? I mean , it isn't like almost of us haven't had a few and then ridden or driven home . * We * just didn't get caught . And I can speak for myself and say it will * never * happen again , but that is beside the point . In answer too there original poster : I'd ensure whatever vehicle is cheapest , a can get you too a from work , a suffer through it for a few years , till your rates drop . And * don't * drink a drive . I had one friend killed bye and drunk , a I was rear ended bye one , totaling my bike ( bent frame ) , a only failing too kill me because I had an eye on my mirror while I waited at there stoplight .
