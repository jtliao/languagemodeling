That torque , a and upright riding position is better then and slightly or radically foreword riding position combined with and high-rpm low torque motor . To a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely bye price , these are there criterion each rider uses too select the vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criterion , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that and sport-bike rider a and cruiser rider maybe have . ( sometime it's hard for * any * motorcycle too fufill and person's requirements ) You're fishing for flames , Dave . This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference between Sports-car owners , and luxury-car owners .
