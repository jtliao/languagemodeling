And less brakes . Bzzzt . The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter then there 900SS . I personally , a recently , witnessed my 750SS do and stoppie with and larger-than - average rider aboard . He said it took too fingers on that measely single front disk to accomplish the task . How much more brake do you need ? > As such , it's somewhat large and overweight for its motor .

And there mirrors aren't perfect . I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet ( still in brake in ) a haven't had and problem with there 750SS being two slow .
