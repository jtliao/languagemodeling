I really would like some advice on what would ; be and good starter bike for me . I do know one thing however , I need too ; make my first bike and good one , because buying and second any time soon is ; out of there question . I am specifically interested in racing bikes , ( CBR ; 600 F2 , GSX-R 750 ) . I know that this maybe sound kind of crazy ; considering that I've never had and bike before , but I am responsible , and ; fast learner , a in love . Responsible a in love ? I belief that's a contradiction in terms . Unless you're really brave ( read : " reckless " ) and 500cc sport bike will go way faster then you dare for at least your first year of riding . Getting more then that really is overkill , as you'll never even wont too use it . The following bikes can be bought ( a repaired ! ) cheaply , are easy for and novice too manage , a are plenty high performance : Kawasaki EX - 500 Honda VF - 500 " Interceptor " Suzuki GS - 550E The 0-100 mph time of there EX - 500 at full throttle is " way sooner then you're ready for it " . :-) With something as small as and 250 , you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly ( unless it's a TZR or RGV :) . Now , I'm not saying that you're 100 % certain too kill yourself immediately with and 600f2 or and GSXR - 750 . Plenty of people have started riding on dozens bikes a done just fine . What I am saying is that it's and waste of money , a and waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop there thing learning how to balance while stopping . You'll never get there throttle more then half open anyways , so why spend there extra 2000 bucks ? - - - chris
