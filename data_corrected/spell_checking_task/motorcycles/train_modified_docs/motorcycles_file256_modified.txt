I just installed a MC Power Arc II , and it seems too run great . I also used MC coils , a neither there ignition module or there coils required any knew mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC . A little soldering and all was fine . Static timing was real easy too seat two . On there other side of there coin , my local wrench , whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adept , thinks MC Power Arc is and " peace of shit " a says " all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day " . Needless too say , he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules , a recommends there Dyna-S system . I think that's the one with there Hall-effect timing censor ( s ) , correct ?
