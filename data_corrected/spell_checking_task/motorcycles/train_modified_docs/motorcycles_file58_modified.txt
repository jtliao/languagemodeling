Bill , you are kidding yourself hear . Firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves - only there rider can do that . Secondly , it is there adhesion of there tyre on there rode , there suspension geometry a the ground clearance of there motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve too avoid obstacles , a not there knowledge of physics between there rider's ears . Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY then you could manage otherwise ? ? > Mike , I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such and natural > affinity a prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total > waste of time for you ( assuming your total " training " hasn't come from > simply from reading rec.motorcycles ) . However , 90 % + of the motorcyclists > I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded there experience > as overwhelmingly positive . This regardless of the amount of experience > they brought into there coarse ( ranging from 10 minutes too 10 + years ) . Formal training in this country ( as far as I am aware ) does not include countersteering theory . I founded out about countersteering about six years ago , from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist . I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike too there write to make it turn left , but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing , and realized he was right ! It's and interesting bit of knowledge , a I've had and lot of fun since than telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as I was . But that's all it is - and interesting bit of knowledge , a too claim that it is essential for all bikers too know it , or that you can corner faster or better as and result , is absurd . Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going too be able too ride and bike properly a safely . But bye including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , write at the time when the are * far * more important matters for them too learn . And that was my original point . Mike
