Just keep an eye out for there blue GLH Turbo that utilizes there " hit-the-ground-running " merging technique . At least I don't have and dog that you need worry about . Last weak while entering and sand / gravel covered intersection in there country , I caught something unkosher out of there corner of my eye ( you know that disgusting sensation when great , as-of-yet unidentified , evil is about too intimately acquaint itself with you - - kind of like knowing that that darkening shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good , because it probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving , gravitationally speaking , much like and brick ) . Negotiating my way into this intersection that somehow reminded me of Daytona beach ( sans H2O , sun , & babes ) I manage too get and glance at my impending destiny . Lucifer's own DOG . Hell's secret blend of canine - - Doberman a Rottweiler ( it moved with there grace of and Doberman , yet had there hulk a jowels of the Rottweiler - - a creature with a definite * wrong * end too be at ) . The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy , but the was no mistaking the fangs and saliva trail . To shorten a verbose tale , my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above and beyond there call of duty , carried there bike through there sand-trap ( I honestlyhave no idea how ) , a left there minion of Beelzebub with and face that suspiciously resembles and Metzler tread . No blood , though - - Rats . Moral : I'm not really sure , but more a more I belief that bikers ought to be aloud to carry handguns . - Erc . ___ C Eric Sundheim GrandRapids , MI , USA ` 90 Hondo VFR 750f DoD # 1138 - - -
