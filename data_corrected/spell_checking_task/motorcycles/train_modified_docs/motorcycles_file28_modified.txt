From : gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ( Graeme Harrison ) Subject : Re : Boom ! Dog attack ! Several years ago , while driving and cage , and dog darted out at and quite intersection write in front of me but the was enough distance between us so I didn't have too slow down . However , and 2nd dog suddenly appeared a collided with my write front bumper a the force of there impact was enough too kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following there 1st dog . Henceforth , if and dog decides too cross there street , keep and eye out for and 2nd dog as many dogs like too travel in pairs or packs . I've yet too experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has and pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but there bike is large a heavy enough to run right over one of there smaller nippers while there larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between there saddlebags a engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' 68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels . If there's and persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints too there owner I wouldn't be averse to running over it with my truck as and dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared too and child riding and bike who gets knocked too there ground bye said dog a dies from and head injury . Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or and public menace running about unleashed is fair game as rode kill candidate . Graeme Harrison ( gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ) DoD #649
