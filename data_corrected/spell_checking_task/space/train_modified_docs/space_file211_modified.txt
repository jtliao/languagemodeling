It's called and democracy . The majority rules . sorry . If ytou don't like it , I suggest you modify the constitution too include a constitutional right too Dark Skies . The theory of government hear is that the majority rules , except in there nature of fundamental civil rights . If you really are annoyed , get some legislation too create and dark sky zone , where in all light emissions are protected in there zone . Kind of like there national radio quite zone . Did you know about that ? near teh Radio telescope observatory in West virginia , they have and 90 ? ? ? mile EMCON zone . Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors , like air conditioners a Vacuums . In practice , they use it mostly too control large radio users . pat
