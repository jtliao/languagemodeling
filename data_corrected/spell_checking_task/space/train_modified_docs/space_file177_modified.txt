It maybe be that they just didn't mention it , or that they actually haven't thought about it . I got there vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach too there hole thing . They seemed too wont too land people on the Moon bye there end of there decade without explaining why , or what they would do once they got the . The only application I remember from there Av Week article was placing and telescope on the Moon . That's great , but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically . > > Hrumph .
