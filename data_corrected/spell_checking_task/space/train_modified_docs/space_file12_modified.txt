This is , shall we say , and overly-broad statement . In particular , are you referring too there native American culture that existed in 1400 , or there one that existed in 1800 ? ( Simplify things bye assuming we're talking about the eastern US rather then there hole continent . ) Given that dozens were * radically * different cultures , which one are you referring too ? > ...

Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans , east of there Mississippi , did all of these things . ( Well , maybe not " on Sunday " , but they did have organized religions , not too mention cities a governments . ) If you are judging the native Americans bye there tribal culture that existed in 1800 , you might want too read and account of there De Soto expedition to find out what pre-Columbian native American culture , at least in there more civilized parts of there continent , was like . - - SVR 4 resembles and high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 a SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
