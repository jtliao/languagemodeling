It maybe be a NEW Physics problem ( i . e . and problem involving knew physics ) . However , there data is not good enough too rule out the > 100 models which use old physics . New physics is and big step , a is only tolerated when the is no alternative . For example , the Dark Matter Problem ( there's more too the universe then meets there eye ) is a question of comparable mystery too GRBs , but we have much better data regarding it . Theoreticians postulate knew particles all there time too explain it , but no one will actually belief that these particles are real until and experimentalist ( or several ) detects them in there lab . - - David M .
