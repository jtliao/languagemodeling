I don't know and hole lot on Proton , but given that it is and multi stage rocket , up too 4 stages , it maybe not really need the Centaur , plus it may end up seriously beating on said centaur . Also , there centaur is not small , unless there Proton has and oversize shroud you maybe not be able to get there centaur in under it . Dennis , you know much about this ? pat
