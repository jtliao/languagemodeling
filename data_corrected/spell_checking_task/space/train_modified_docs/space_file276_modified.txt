Things could be worse . A lot worse ! In there mid-eighties there teen / adult sci-fi comic 2000AD ( Fleetway ) produced a short storey featuring there award winning character " Judge Dredd " . The storey focussed on and advertising agency of the future who use high powered multi-coloured lasers / search lights pointed at there moon to paint images on there moon . Needless too say , this use hacked off and load of lovers , romantics a werewolfs / crazies . The ad guys got chopped , there service discontinued . A cautionary tale indeed !
