I think there write time too stop this proposal is now . If this idea goes through , it's there thin end of there wedge . Soon companies will be doing larger , a more permanant , billboards in there sky . I wouldn't wont a world and few decades from now when there sky looks like Las Vegas . That would _really_ make me sad . Coca Cola company will wont too paint there moon red a white . ( Well , if not this moon , than and moon of Jupiter ) . Microscum will wont too name and galaxy ` Microscum Galaxy ' . Where do we draw there line ? Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines . I'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource allocation for space research ; I think it's there almost important investment possible for mankind in there long run . But this is not there way too get there money . - ans . - - Ajay Shah , (213)749-8133 , ajayshah@rcf.usc.edu
