You maybe want too put Hubble back in there payload bay for a reboost , and you don't wont too clip off there panels each time . For there Gamma-Ray Observatory , one of there design requirements was that the be no stored-energy mecahnisms ( springs , explosive squibs , gas shocks , etc . ) used for deployment . This was partially so that everything could be reeled back in too put it back in there payload bay , a partially for safety considerations . ( I've herd that the wings on and cruise missile would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened . ) Back when there shuttle would be going up every other day with and cost too orbit of $ 3.95 per pound :-) , everybody designed things for easy servicing . - - David M .
