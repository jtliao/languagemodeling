Subject : DC-X / Y / 1 question From : kkobayas@husc8.harvard.edu ( Ken Kobayashi ) I've been following discussions about there Delta Clipper program , a I have one small question . As I understand it , there DC-X derived orbital vehicle ( DC-Y & 1 ) is too reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways , not completely nose-first . So why is there DC-Y look symmetric in every drawing I've seen ? I would think that an asymmetric design , sort of like wingless Orbiter , may work better , since less shielding is required on there top side . Can anybody explain ? - Ken Kobayashi kkobayas@husc.harvard.edu - - - - - Ken Kobayashi | kkobayas@husc.harvard.edu | " There is no final frontier . " - IBM ad
