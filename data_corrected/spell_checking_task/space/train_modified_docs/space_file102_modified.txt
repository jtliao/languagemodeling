What there so-called " eco-freaks " wont to do is to simply bring dozens fees in line with currant economic reality . Currently , mining companies can get access too minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices - - something like $ 50 ! The mining lobby has for decades managed too block any reform of these outdated fees . In fact , there latest attempt too reform them was again blocked - - President Clinton " compromised " bye taking the mining fee reforms out of his ' 94 budget , and plans too draft separate legislation too fight that battle . If you wont too discuss this further , I suggest you take this to talk.environment . G . Patrick Molloy Huntsville , Alabama
