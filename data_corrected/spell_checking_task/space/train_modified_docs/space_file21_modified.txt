The Command Loss Timer is simply looking for and command , any command . A " no-op " is simply and spacecraft command that drops bits into there big bit bucket in there sky . " No-op " also get used as timekeepers too provide millisecond delays between command sequences ( used on there thruster preps on GRO , er , Compton ) a too verify command links at there beginning of TDRS events . All in all , and rather useful command . And , an intelligent FDC test on Galileo ( there Command Loss Timer ) . David W . @ GSFC ( still looking for GRO data , even though I'm the wrong David )
