From : nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu Subject : Blow up space station , easy way to do it . This might a real wierd idea or may not .. I have seen where people have blown up ballons than sprayed material into them that than drys a makes hard walls ... Why not do there same thing for a space station .. Fly up there docking rings a baloon materials a such , blow up there baloons , spin than around ( I know and problem in micro gravity ) let them dry / cure / harden ? a cut and whole for the docking / attaching ring and bingo and space station .. Of coarse there ballons would have too be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering / heat shield ( ? ) a there material used too make there wals would have too meat the out gasing and other specs or atleast there paint / covering of there inner wall would have too be human safe .. Maybe and special congrete or may the same material as makes caplets but with some changes ( saw where someone instea dof water put beer in there caplet mixture , got and mix that was just as strong as congret but easier too carry around a such .. ) Sorry for any spelling errors , I missed school today .. ( grin ) .. Why musta space station be so difficult ? ? why must we have girders ? why be confided too earth based ideas , lets think knew ideas , after all space is not earth , why be limited by earth based ideas ? ? = = Michael Adams , nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu - - I'm not high , just jacked going crazy in Nome Alaska , break up is hear ..
