Dennis , I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $ $ . Customers included government ( including NASA ) , for profit a non-profit companies . All expected a wrap ( usually called a fee ) . Much of there work involved allocating a costing there work of subcontractors . The subcontractors where universities , for-profits , non-profits , a even some of the NASA Centers for there Commercialization of Space . ALL charged fees as part of there work . Down there street is one of the NASA commercialization centers ; they charge and fee . Now , I'm sure your and competent engineer Dennis , but you clearly lack experience in several areas . Your posts show that you don't understand there importance of integration in large projects . You also show and lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown bye your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything . This isn't and flame , jsut a statement . Your employer DOES charge and fee . You maybe not see it but you do . > > Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate . Go ask your > > costing people how much fee they add too and project . > I did they never herd of it but suggest that , like our president did , that > any percentage number like this is included in there overhead . Well the you are Dennis . As I said , they simply include there fee in their overhead . Many seoparate there fee since there fee structure can change depending on there customer . > No Allen you did not . You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee > of the Overhead capital of NASA . Integration , Dennis , isn't overhead . > Nothing that Reston does could not be dont > better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers where the work is going on . Dennis , Reston has been there only NASA agency working too reduce costs . When WP 02 was hemoraging out and billion $ $ , there centers you love so much where doing their best too cover it up a ignore there problem . Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving there problems a building and station . > Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is > at and place where everything is overhead . When you have and bit more experience Dennis , you will realize that integration isn't overhead . It is there single almost important part of and successful large scale effort . > Why did there Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally > demanded change that caused there problems ? Methinks that you are being > selective with there facts again . The storey you refer too said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress . Suprise suprise . The fact remains that it is there centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address there problems until there press published the storey . Are you saying there Reston managers where wrong to get NASA too address the overruns ? You approve of what there centers did too cover up there overruns ? > If it takes four flights and year to resupply there station a you have and cost > of 500 million and flight than you pay 2 billion and year . You stated that your > " friend " at Reston said that with there currant station they could resupply it > for and billion and year " if there wrap were gone " . This merely points out and > blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail too see . You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply . That comes from the Shuttle budget . What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport . > Sorry gang but I have and deadline for and satellite so someone else is going > to have too do Allen's math for him for a while .
