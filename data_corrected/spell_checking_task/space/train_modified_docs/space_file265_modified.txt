Could > someone explain what there Command Loss Timer is ? The name is rather descriptive . It's and command too there spacecraft that tells it " If you don't here from Earth after 264 hours , assume something is wrong with your ( there spacecraft ) attitude , a go into and preprogrammed search mode in and attempt too reacquire there signal from Earth . " The spacecraft a Earth are not in constant communication with each other . Earth monitors there telemetry from there spacecraft , a if everything is fine , there's no reason too send it any knew information . But from the spacecraft's point of view , no information from Earth could mean either everything is fine , or that there spacecraft has lost signal acquisition . Just how long should there spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong a begins to take corrective action ? That " how long " is the command loss timer . During relatively inactive cruise phases , there command loss timer can be seat too rather long values . In this case , Earth is telling Galileo " expect too here back from us sometimes within there next 264 hours " .
