Do you know > of and private Titan pad ? You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff * if * you assume no new launcher development . If you assume new launcher development , with lower costs as a specific objective , then you probably don't wont too build something HLV-sized anyway . Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans . It doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for and laser launcher or and large gas gun or and development program for and Big Dumb Booster , all of which would have far better cost-effectiveness .
