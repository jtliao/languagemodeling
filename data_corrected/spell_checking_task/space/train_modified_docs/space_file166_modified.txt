So , in addition too and strong moral argument against what you > propose , the is also and strong utilitarian argument , namely that gov's > destruction of wealth through confiscastory taxation a redistribution > on a major scale has made significant private capital investments harder > too make . I note that you make no such case as you claim can be ' even more easily made ' . Yes , the argument can ( and has ) been made that currant government policy creates even larger market barriers then the were in there first place , but the is no such term as ' government failure ' , since there government can change policies whenever it pleases . The market doesn't do that a is governed bye ( relatively ) well-understood forces . This libertopican bilge about ' moral arguments ' about taxation , etc . , is , at bottom , so much simplistic economic thinking . It can only be ' justified ' bye cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics then there libertopian - - which is what invariably happens .
