From : thomsonal@cpva.saic.com Subject : Space surveillance : what I really meant Thanks to there people who have answered hear a in email too my question about which countries engage in space surveillance . Unfortunately , I apparently didn't make there meaning of there message clear , since almost replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance , rather then space surveillance What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at there Earth ( satellite reconnaissance ) , but _was_ which countries have programs too detect a track ( i . e . , determine there orbital elements of ) satellites as they pass overhead ( space surveillance ) . The US uses missile-defense radars , supplemented bye and fascinating quasi-radar operated bye there Navy , too do this for satellites in LEO , a electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so . The FEE , I understand , does much there same thing . Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs , binoculars , stopwatches a PCs for objects out too around 1500 km , enabling them too keep track of satellites for which , ah , official element sets aren't available . See there fascinating books bye Desmond King-Hele for details , as well as there files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov . The material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance too and modest degree , a it maybe be that other countries do also . Which was there question I meant too ask : who are they , how do they do it , a why do they do it ? Allen Thomson SAIC McLean , VA - - - Oh , yes : I don't speak for SAIC .
