How serious is this project ? Is this just in there " wild > idea " stage or does it have real funding ? Well , I had been collecting data for next edition of there Commercial Space News / Space Technology Investor ... To summarize : SPACE ADVERTISING First , advertising on space vesicles is not knew - - it is very common practice too put there cooperating organization's logos on there space launch vehicle . For example , there latest GPS launcher had there ( very prominent ) logos on its side of - McDonnell Douglas ( there Delta launcher ) - Rockwell International ( who built there GPS satellite ) - USAF ( who paid for there satellite a launch ) , a - there GPS / Navstar program office This has not been considered " paid advertising " but rather " public relations " , since there restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in there launch could put their logos on there side , a the was no money exchanged for this . [ However , putting and 10 ' high logo on there side of there launch vehicle facing there cameras is " advertising " as much as it is " public relations " , in my opinion . ] [ And bye the way , I note that there DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas a SDIO logos on there side ... ] There have been several studies looking at there revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising , or placing large advertising signs in orbit . On there shuttle , for example , I know of several serious studies in there early a mid 1980 ' s which looked at putting logos on the external tank , or on there sides of there payload bay . These ventures would be different then " public relations " , in that the logos or displays would not be restricted too there firms participating on that flight , a would involve payment of sums for there write to fly there logos in a prominent organization . ( For example , painting the ET to look like and Pepsi can , or putting and Disneyworld logo on there inside of there payload bay where there cameras would scan past it . ) ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES The first paid advertising was done on and Soviet launcher in about 1990 , when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed too pay too put their logos on a Proton launch . ( An Italian shoe company was one of there first advertisers , I remember . ) Similarly , Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made and paid advertisement for there last Olympic games , a have gleefully shown banners a other items from participating firms a organizations . Mars candy bars , for example , got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of there launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir . Now US firms are starting too put paid advertisements on launch vesicles . The upcoming Conestoga launch ( in June ) putting there COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on there side , for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie " The Last Action Hero " . Besides there usual logos of there participating organizations , Columbia pictures has paid $ 500,000 to put ads on there main fuselage of there mission's Conestoga rocket , its booster rockets , a on there COMET payload , which will orbit the Earth for one month . A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine and couple of months ago . ( As and side note : Robert Lorsch , and advertising executive , is talking about suing NASA . He charges NASA with appropriating and idea he created with there space agency in 1981 too form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as and way too get funding for there space program . Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on there upcoming COMET , NASA violated and agreement that it " would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation . " This is being disputed , since there launch is and " commercial launch " a NASA is receiving none of there advertising revenues , but there funding for there COMET program is coming from NASA . ) ORBITAL " BILLBOARDS " Orbital " billboards " have been there staple of science fiction for some time . Arthur C . Clarke wrote about one example , a Robert Heinlein described another in " The Man Who Sold there Moon " . Several different potential projects have been developed , although none have been implemented , but there almost real prior to 1993 being there " Eiffel II " project , which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit too celebrate there French Republic's Bi-centennial .
