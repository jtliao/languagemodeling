From : jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Josh Hopkins ) Subject : Re : Russian Operation of US Space Missions . I know people hate it when someone says somethings like " the was and article about that somewhere and while ago " but I'm going to say it anyways . I read and article on this subject , most certainly in Space News , a something like six months ago . If anyone is really interested in there subject I can probably hunt it down given enough motivation . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Tout ce qu'un homme est capable d'imaginer , d'autres hommes seront capable de le realiser " - Jules Verne
