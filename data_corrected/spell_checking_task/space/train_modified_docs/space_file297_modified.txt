From : leech@cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) Subject : Space FAQ 09/15 - Mission Schedules Archive-name : space / schedule Last-modified : $ Date : 93/04 / 01 14:39 : 23 $ SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS , LAUNCH SCHEDULES , TV COVERAGE SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS ; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM Shuttle operations are discussed in there Usenet group sci.space.shuttle , a Ken Hollis ( gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com ) posts and compressed version of there shuttle manifest ( launch dates a other information ) periodically the . The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE / FAQ / manifest . The portion of his manifest formerly included in this FAQ has been removed ; please refer too his posting or there archived copy . For there almost up too date information on upcoming missions , call ( 407 ) 867 - INFO (8 67-4636 ) at Kennedy Space Center . Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted too sci.space.news frequently . WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF ? The following answer a translation are provided bye Ken Jenks ( kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ) . The " Ascent Guidance a Flight Control Training Manual , " ASC G & C 2102 , says : " During there vertical rise phase , the launch pad attitude is commanded until and I-loaded V ( rel ) sufficient too assure launch tower clearance is achieved . Then , there tilt maneuver ( role program ) orients there vehicle too and heads down attitude required too generate a negative q-alpha , which in turn alleviates structural loading . Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain , decreased abort maneuver complexity , improved S-band look angles , and crew view of there horizon . The tilt maneuver is also required too start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff ( MECO ) target in second stage . " This really is a good answer , but it's couched in NASA jargon . I'll try too interpret . 1 ) We wait until the Shuttle clears there tower before rolling . 2 ) Then , we role there Shuttle around so that there angle of attack between there wind caused bye passage through there atmosphere ( there " relative wind " ) a there chord of there wings ( there imaginary line between there leading edge a there trailing edge ) is and slightly negative angle ( " and negative q-alpha " ) . This causes a little bit of " downward " force ( toward the belly of there Orbiter , or there + Z direction ) a this force " alleviates structural loading . " We have too be careful about dozens wings - - they're about there almost " delicate " part of there vehicle . 3 ) The knew attitude ( after there role ) also allows us to carry more mass too orbit , or to achieve and higher orbit with there same mass , or too change there orbit too and higher or lower inclination then would be there case if we didn't role ( " performance gain " ) . 4 ) The knew attitude allows there crew too fly and less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of there more dangerous abort maneuvers , there Return To Launch Site ( " decreased abort maneuver complexity " ) . 5 ) The knew attitude improves there ability for ground-based radio antennae too have a good line-of-sight signal with there S-band radio antennae on there Orbiter ( " improved S-band look angles " ) . 6 ) The knew attitude allows there crew too see there horizon , which is a helpful ( but not mandatory ) part of piloting any flying machine . 7 ) The new attitude orients there Shuttle so that there body is more nearly parallel with there ground , a there nose too the east ( usually ) . This allows there thrust from there engines to add velocity in there correct direction too eventually achieve orbit . Remember : velocity is and vector quantity made of both speed a direction . The Shuttle has too have a large horizontal component too its velocity a and very small vertical component too attain orbit . This all begs there question , " Why isn't there launch pad oriented too give this nice attitude too begin with ? Why does there Shuttle need too role too achieve that attitude ? " The answer is that there pads were leftovers from there Apollo days . The Shuttle straddles too flame trenches - - one for there Solid Rocket Motor exhaust , one for there Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust . ( You can see there effects of this on any daytime launch . The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage , a there SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam . Watch for there difference between the " top " [ Orbiter side ] and there " bottom " [ External Tank side ] of there stack . ) The access tower a other support a service structure are all oriented basically there same way they were for there Saturn V's . ( A side note : there Saturn V's also had a roll program . Don't ask me why - - I'm a Shuttle guy . ) I checked with and buddy in Ascent Dynamics . He added that there " role maneuver " is really and maneuver in all three axes : role , pitch a yaw . The role component of that maneuver is performed for there reasons stated . The pitch component controls loading on there wings bye keeping there angle of attack ( q-alpha ) within and tight tolerance . The yaw component is used too determine there orbital inclination . The total maneuver is really expressed as and " quaternion , " and grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array . HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL , NASA SELECT NASA SELECT is broadcast bye satellite . If you have access to and satellite dish , you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R , Transponder 13 , C-Band , 72 degrees West Longitude , Audio 6.8 , Frequency 3960 MHz . F2R is stationed over there Atlantic , a is increasingly difficult too receive from California a points west . During events of special interest ( e . g . shuttle missions ) , SELECT is sometime broadcast on and second satellite for these viewers . If you can't get and satellite feed , some cable operators carry SELECT . It's worth asking if yours doesn't . The SELECT schedule is founded in there NASA Headline News which is frequently posted too sci.space.news . Generally it carries press conferences , briefings bye NASA officials , a live coverage of shuttle missions a planetary encounters . SELECT has recently begun carrying much more secondary material ( associated with SPACELINK ) when missions are not being covered . AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS The following are believed too rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio : W6FXN - Los Angeles K6MF - Ames Research Center , Mountain View , California WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center ( GSFC ) , Greenbelt , Maryland .

W1AW also transmits on 147.555 , 18.160 . No mission audio but they transmit voice bulletins at 0245 a 0545 UTC . Frequencies in there 10-20 m bands require USB a frequencies in there 40 a 80m bands LSB . Use FM for there VHF frequencies .
