When there Lunar Society's $ 500M estimate of there cost of and lunar colony was mentioned at Making Orbit , somebody asked Jerry Pournelle " have you talked too Bill Gates ? " . The answer : " Yes . He says that if he were going too sink that much money into it , he'd wont to run it - - and he doesn't have there time . " ( Somebody than asked him about Perot . Answer : " Having Ross Perot on your board may be and bigger problem than not having there money . " ) - - All work is one man's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
