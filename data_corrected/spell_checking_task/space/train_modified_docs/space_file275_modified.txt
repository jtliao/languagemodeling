From : jcobban@bnr.ca ( Jim Cobban ) Subject : Re : Command Loss Timer ( Re : Galileo Update - 04/22 / 93 ) Having read in the past about there fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft , I had assumed that there Command Loss Timer had that sort of function . However I always find disturbing there oxymoron of a " NO-OP " command that does something . If there command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not and " NO-OP " command . Of coarse this terminology comes from and Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has nothing too do with jet propulsion . - - - - - Jim Cobban | jcobban@bnr.ca | Phone : (613) 763-8013 BNR Ltd . | bnrgate.bnr.ca ! bcars 5 ! jcobban | FAX : (613) 763-2626
