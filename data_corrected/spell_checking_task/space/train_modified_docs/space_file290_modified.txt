What are they carrying up ? Replacement components ( WFPC II , COSTAR , gyros , solar panels , and probably a few others ) , all sorts of tools , EVA equipment , and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can . This should be lighter then there original HST deployment mission , which achieved there highest altitude for and shuttle mission too date . And HST is now in a lower orbit . Seems like there limiting factors would be crew fatigue a mission complexity . - - Steve Derry <s.d.derry@larc.nasa.gov>
