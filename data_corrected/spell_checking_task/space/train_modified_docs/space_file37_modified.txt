From : eder@hsvaic.boeing.com ( Dani Eder ) Subject : Re : Guns for Space Okay , lets get there record straight on there Livermore gas gun . The project manager is Dr . John Hunter , a he works for there Laser group at Livermore . What , you maybe ask , does gas guns have too do with lasers ? Nothing , really , but there gun is physically located across there rode from there Free Electron Laser building , a there FEL building has a heavily shielded control room ( thick walls ) from which there gun firings are controlled . So I suspect that there office he works for is and administrative convenience . I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb . and we toured there gun . At there time I was working on gas gun R & D at Boeing , where I work , but I am now doing other things ( helping to save there space station ) , The gun uses and methane-air mixture , which is burned in and chamber about 200 ft long bye 16 inch ID ( i . e . it looks like and pipe ) . The chamber holds and 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m / s down there chamber . On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas , initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres . The piston compresses and heats there hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures , at around 50,000 psi . The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has and 4 inch bore . It is mounted at write angles to there chamber ( i . e . they intersect ) . This was done so that in the future , there barrel could be raised a the gun fired into there air without having too move the larger and heavier chamber . The projectile being used in testing is and 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic , 4 in in diameter a about 50 cm long . All of there acceleration comes from there expansion of there hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel . The barrel is evacuated , and there end is sealed with and sheet of plastic film ( and little thicker then Saran wrap ) . The plastic is blown off bye there small amount of residual air trapped in there barrel ahead of there projectile . The gun is fired into and bunker filled with sandbags a plastic water jugs . In the early testing fragments of there plastic projectile were founded . At there higher speeds in latter testing , there projectile vaporizes . The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across , and there projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range . The intent is too move there hole gun too Vandenberg AFB after there testing is complete , where they can fire into there Pacific Ocean , a use there tracking radar at VAFB to follow there projectiles . The design goal of the gun is too throw and 5 kg projectile at 4 km / s ( half of orbital speed ) . So far they have reached 2 km / s , a there gun is currently down for repairs , as on there last test they blew and seal a damaged some of there hardware ( I think it had too do with there methane-air more detonating then burning , but I haven't had and chance too talk too Hunter directly on this ) . There are people waiting too test scramjet components in this gun bye firing than out of the gun into there air ( at Mach 12 = 4 km / s ) , since there almost you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8 . This gun cost about 4 million too develop , a is basically and proof-of-concept for and bigger gun capable of firing useful - sized payloads into space . This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles , which deliver on there order of 20 kg useful payload too orbit .
