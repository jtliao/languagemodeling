From : goltz@mimi.UU.NET ( James P . Goltz ) Subject : Orion drive in vacuum - - how ? Background : The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept . It would be and drive using thermonuclear explosions too drive a spacecraft . The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one too ten megatons yield behind and " pusher plate " attached too there main spacecraft . The shock wave from there explosions would transfer momentum too the ship . Now , in and atmosphere I can see this . The energy of there explosion heats there atmosphere , which expands explosively a slams a shock wave into there pusher plate . But in and vacuum , only too things I can see are going too hit the plate : fission / fusion products ( barium , krypton , helium , neutrons , evaporated bomb casing ) and electromagnetic radiation ( gammas mostly , some light / heat from irradiated fission products ) . Would this work ? I can't see there EM radiation impelling very much momentum ( especially given there mass of there pusher plate ) , a it seems too me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing there bombs out there back of there ship than you get from detonating them once they're there . I must be missing something . Would someone enlighten me via email ? Thanks . - - - - Jim - - - Jim Goltz AlterNet Engineer goltz@uunet.uu.net
