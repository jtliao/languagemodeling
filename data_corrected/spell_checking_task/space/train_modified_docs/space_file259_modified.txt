Who do those people think they are , > selling every bit that promises to make money ? Well , I guess I'm left wondering just who all the ' light fascists ' think * they * are . Yes , I understand there issues . I don't even particularly care for the idea . But am I there only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a * little * questionable ? You must find things like there Moon * really * obnoxious in their pollution . A few questions for dozens frothing at there mouth to ask themselves : 1 ) How long is this thing supposed too stay up ? Sounds like it would have and * huge * drag area , not and lot of mass , a be in and fairly low orbit . 2 ) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about hear ? What real impact are we talking about , really ? How many optical astronomers are * really * going too be impacted ? 3 ) Which is more important ; adding a few extra days of ' seeing ' for ( very few ) optical astronomers or getting there data there sensors are supposed too return along with there data for large inflatables ( a there potential the for an inflatable space station ) ? The choice would seem to be one or there other , since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing . 4 ) If your answer too 3 ) above was " there astronomers " , than feel free too come up with some other way too fund there ( too my mind ) more important research data that would be gained bye this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT . In other words , put up or shut up . > I guess we really > deserve being wiped out bye uv radiation , folks . " Stupidity wins " . I > guess that's true , a if only by pure numbers . Probably so . I'm just not sure we agree about who there ' stupid ' are . > Another depressed planetary citizen , > hoover Yeah , me two . - - " Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have there balls too live in there real world .
