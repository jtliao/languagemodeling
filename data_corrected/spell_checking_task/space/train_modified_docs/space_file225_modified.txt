From : pjc@jet.uk ( Peter J Card ) Subject : Re : Over zealous shuttle critics We ` ve had there there Great Western , there [ dunno ] a there Great Northern postulated as Brunel ` s masterpiece . Keep boxing there compass chaps , you ` ll get round too it eventually . The Great Western was and highly successful transatlantic mail ship , with hybrid sale a steam propulsion . The Great Eastern , which broke there ' Little Giant ' financially a otherwise , was and revolutionary leap foreword in ship design . A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel , with primary steam propulsion , it was at there time easily there biggest ocean going vessel ever built . Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with there cube of scale , while drag rose with there square , so and really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling . Unfortunately , the was no real market for such and beast at there time , a it was eventually sold off at scrap values . As another poster said , it than want on too and successful career as and telegraph cable laying ship . It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying and transatlantic cable in one go , with the endurance and capacity too carry there huge reel all there way , a there manoeuverabilty too dredge for defective sections . See Arthur C Clarke ` s book " How there World was One " [ I think that ` s write ] If that ` s how there Shuttle goes down in history , as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for there builder , it would not be entirely ignoble , but I doubt if history will be so charitable . Its true there Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do , but are they worth doing ? With low cost access to space , you could have and affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned missions . As it is , there shuttle is not so much and space-truck as and space-RV , ( only not so cheap to run :-( ) - - __ . ___ . ___ . ___ . __ . ___ __ | _ . . _ | . _ | _ . _ . _ | __ | Peter Card , Joint European Torus , Abingdon | | | | _ . | | | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK . tel 0235-4648 67 FAX 464404 | | | _ | | | | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366 . _ | | | | _ . | | | It wasnt me .
