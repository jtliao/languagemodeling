From : nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu Subject : Alaska Pipeline a Space Station , Go Commerical . Sounds liek what there FED has too do is sign and 50 or more year lease too use certain parts of and space station that is built a designed a such bye and commerical company or consortium of companies ( such as like Alyeska ) for a small amount of rent in return for certain incentives and such .. Such as tax and other right off and also and monopoly on certain products .. The commerical builders would have certain perks given too them too make the end easier ( taxes , contracts , regulatory concesions a such .. ) Is it workable , just might work .. After all , if China can lease out Hong Kong a there people of Hong Kong can make money , this could work .. = = Michael Adams , nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu - - I'm not high , just jacked
