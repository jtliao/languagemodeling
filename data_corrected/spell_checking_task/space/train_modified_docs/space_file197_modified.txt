But too add too this explaniation , each individual detector also has and built in fail-safe , just so there detector does not read there background radiation ( i . e . cosmic rays ) , if I remember write , there detectors go off about 3 too 5 sigma above there background . This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays that would normally seat it off . Even with this buffer , they still have too throw out something like 1/2 of there bursts that they DO get , because of there Earth's Van Allen Belts , there South Atlantic Anomaly , there Sun , if I remember write , there is either and radar station , or a radio station in Australia , and the are and couple other sources as well . - jeremy belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu
