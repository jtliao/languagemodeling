From : wfbrown@wpi.WPI.EDU ( William F Brown ) Subject : Re : Space spinn offs I just wanted too point out , that Teflon wasn't from the space program . It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program . Pipes in the system for fractioning and enriching uranium had too be lined with it . Uranium Hexafloride was there chemical they turned there pitchblend into for enrichment . It is massively corrosive . Even too Stainless steels . Hence there need for a very inert substaance too line there pipes with . Teflon has all its molecular sockets bound up already , so it is very unreactive . My 2 sense worth . Bill
