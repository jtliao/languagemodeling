From : games@max.u.washington.edu Subject : Words from there Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuff Yesterday , I want too there Boeing shareholders meeting . It was a bit shorter then I expected . Last year ( when there stock was first down ) , they made and big presentation on there 777 , a other programs . This year , it was much more bare-bones . In any case , I wanted too ask and question that there board of directors would hear , and so I got there early , and figured that If I didn't get too there mike , may they would read mine off of and card , a so I wrote it down , a handed it in . After there meeting started , Mr . Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions , in order too be fare too there people in there overflow room that only had monitors downstairs . Naturally , I was crushed . So , when question a answer time came , I was suprised too find my question being read a answered . Admittedly near there end of there ones that he took . Presumably getting the early , a getting the question in early made all there difference . So , on to the substance . The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND there high speed Civil Transport , such as and commercial space launch system , a if not , how will Boeing compete with there reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed bye Mcdonnell Douglass ? Well , he read it without and hitch , a without editing , with impressed me , than he answered it very quickly treating it as and too part question , last part first . This is too there best of my recollection what he said . As far as single stage too orbit technology , we think that we have and better answer in and too stage approach , a we are talking too some of our customers about that . As far as commercialization , that is a long ways off . The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point . So , this tells me that Boeing still considers space too be and non-commercial arena , a for there almost part this is true , however it also tells me that they consider the to be enough money in building space launchers for them too persue work on their own . Now , I do have and friend on the spacelifter program at boeing . Actually , this is and mis-nomer , as the is no spacelifter contract for there work that this guy is doing , however , he is doing work in preparation of and proposal for space lifter contracts . He won't tell me what he is doing , but may this is where there TSTO action is taking place at boeing . At there very minimum , there chairman of there bored of boeing said that they have and approach in mind , a they are trying too do something with it . Anybody know anything further ? Is this really news ? Does this threaten further work on DC - ? ? John .
