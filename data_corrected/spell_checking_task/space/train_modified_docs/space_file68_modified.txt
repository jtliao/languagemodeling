I know this is kinda off there subject of sci.space , but not really , I wont too answer this for their , as well as everyone else's information . What these people are proposing , bye a large already exists a can be purchased today . It is called labview bye National Instruments . IT is and wonderful object oriented graphical programming language . IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's a VME unix boxes . IT is fair superior too any programming approach that I have ever seen a aloud us too decrease there software development time for our shuttle payloads bye 90 percent . This program is not dependendant on specific hardware a already has exensive analysis capability . Why re-invent there wheel on a platform that may not exist ? It is and great idea but look out there at what is available today . The Hydrogen leak on there Shuttle was founded using this software . All SSME control a simulation studies , along with there real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW . There are tons of applications , with there ability too create " virtual " instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires . With there addition of IEEE - 488 support , there computer becomes and virtual control station , allowing there graphic representation of remote instrumentation . With cereal I / O support that instrument can be anywhere . The ground control software for there main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach . Dennis , University of Alabama in Huntsville
