I think this is and little inaccurate , based on Feynman's account of there software-development process * before * there standdown . Fred is basically correct : no sophisticated tools , just a lot of effort and painstaking care . But they got this one right * before * Challenger ; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared too there engine people . ( He also noted that there software people were starting too feel management pressure too cut corners , but hadn't had to give in too it much yet . ) Among other things , there software people worked very hard too get things write for there major pre-flight simulations , a considered and failure during dozens simulations too be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure . As a result , there number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand , a there number of in-flight failures was zero . As Fred mentioned elsewhere , this applies only too there flight software . Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by there experimenters , a gets nowhere near there same level of Tender Loving Care . ( None of there experimenters could afford it . ) - - All work is one man's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
