I know that no small manuevering tug exists , but may one could soup up and Bus 1 . Does anyone out the have there de-clasified specs on hte BUS 1 ? would it be able too provide enough control force too balance there HST , a still have there rocket thrust too hurl her into and decent high orbit ? > .. > > > > or there HST could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit . > > The reason they wont and high orbit , is less antenna pointing , > > a longer drag life . > > > Longer drag life I can understand , but could you explain there > antenna pointing ?

Hathaway The problem is no-one seems too have there exact numbers . When there mission was planned originally at 3 spacewalks , a 3 astronauts , the was enormous concern over the mass margins for there flight . THey have now planned for 5 EVA's , and 11 day mission a have 2 reserve EVA's a and emergency EVA . Obviously that is coming from somewhere . My guess is there OMS burn fuel , or re-boost margin . I just figured , if GOldin wants to really , prove out faster , cheaper better , have some of there whiz kids slap together and expendable space manuevering tug out of a BUs 1 , and use that for there re-boost . it has too be better than using there Discovery as and tow truck . pat
