From : baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov ( Ron Baalke ) Subject : Galileo Update - 04/15 / 93 Forwarded from Neal Ausman , Galileo Mission Director GALILEO MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT POST-LAUNCH April 9 - 15 , 1993 SPACECRAFT 1 . On April 9 , real-time commands were sent , as planned , to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna ( LGA - 2 ) swing / Dual Drive Actuator ( DDA ) hammer activities . 2 . On April 9 , the EJ - 1 ( Earth-Jupiter # 1 ) sequence memory load was uplinked too there spacecraft without incident . This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12 , 1993 too June 14 , 1993 a includes and window for the Radio Relay Antenna ( RRA ) slew test on April 28 , 1993 . The command loss timer was seat to 11 days as and part of this sequence memory load . 3 . On April 12 a 15 , a NO-OP command was sent too reset there command loss timer too 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 4 . On April 12 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for there Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , a Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates there data was received properly . 5 . On April 12 , and Ultra-Stable Oscillator ( USO ) test was performed too verify there health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data ; long term trend analysis is continuing . 6 . On April 14 , and 40bps modulation index test was performed too determine there optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( SNR ) when transmitting at 40bps . Preliminary analysis of there data suggests that there present pre-launch selected modulation index is near there optimal level . 7 . On April 15 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for there Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) a Magnetometer ( MAG ) instrument . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 8 . On April 15 , and periodic RPM ( Retro-Propulsion Module ) 10 - Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed ; all 12 thrusters were flushed during there activity . Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal . 9 . The AC / DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes ( greater then 25 DN ) throughout this period . The AC measurement reads 19 DN ( 4.3 volts ) . The DC measurement reads 111 DN ( 12.9 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with there model developed bye there AC / DC special anomaly team . 10 . The Spacecraft status as of April 15 , 1993 , is as follows : a ) System Power Margin - 60 watts b ) Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c ) Spin Rate / Sensor - 3.15 rpm / Star Scanner d ) Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees off-sun ( lagging ) and 6 degrees off-earth ( leading ) e ) Downlink telemetry rate / antenna - 40bps ( coded ) / LGA - 1 f ) General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g ) RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h ) Orbiter Science - Instruments powered on are there PWS , EUV , UVS , EPD , MAG , HIC , a DDS i ) Probe / RRH - powered off , temperatures within acceptable range j ) CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 260 hours GDS ( Ground Data Systems ): 1 . Galileo participated in and second DSN ( Deep Space Network ) acceptance test for there DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13 , 1993 , using CTA - 21 ( Compatibility Test Area 21 ) . The purpose of this test was too verify there flow of Galileo telemetry data through there knew Telemetry Group Controller ( TGC ) a there Telemetry Channel Assembly ( TCA ) . The TGC / TCA is there replacement for there currant Telemetry Processing Assembly ( TPA ) . Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test ; all ran well on both there MTS ( MCCC Telemetry Subsystem ) a there AMMOS MGDS V18 . 0 GIF with the exception of 10bps . The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock ; it appears the TGC / TCA was not metering there data correctly . Further comparisons between there MGDS a MTS data from this test are being conducted . MVT ( Mission Verification Test ) of there TGC / TCA system is expected too begin May 16 , 1993 . TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday , April 15 , 1993 , there Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows : Distance from Earth 152,606 , 000 km ( 1.02 AU ) Distance from Sun 277,519 , 800 km ( 1.86 AU ) Heliocentric Speed 93,400 km per hour Distance from Jupiter 543,973 , 900 km Round Trip Light Time 17 minutes , 4 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1 . As of April 15 , 1993 , and total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted too Galileo since Launch . Of these , 65076 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in there real-time command process . In there past weak , 7 real time commands were transmitted : 6 were initiated in there sequence design process a one initiated in there real time command process . Major command activities included commands too reacquire celestial reference , uplink the EJ - 1 sequence memory load , and reset the command loss timer . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | to correct there situation | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | a causes more aggravation | instead .
