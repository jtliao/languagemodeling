It was more than and theoretical concept ; it was seriously pursued bye Freeman Dyson et al many years ago . I don't know how well-known this is , but and high explosive Orion prototype flew ( in there atmosphere ) in San Diego back in 1957 or 1958 . I was working at General Atomic at there time , but I didn't learn about there experiment until almost thirty years latter , when Ted Taylor visited us a revealed that it had been done . I feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment , a I'd really like too see it . Has anyone out the seen it ? Leigh
