From what I understand from Dr . Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable problem in bringing HST back . IT was designed that way too begin with . Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items replaced on this mission . The originals were built bye Brit Aerospace and I think there knew ones are two . I am currently working with there guys at MSFC that are in charge is there HST power system , although I have not spoken with them in and long time about HST .
