Nick's write about this . It's always easier too obtain forgiveness then permission . Not many people remember that Britain's King George III expressly forbid his american subjects too cross there alleghany / appalachian mountains . Said subjects basically said , " Stop us if you can . " He couldn't . > If you go to the moon as declare that you are now and soverign nation , who will > stop you from doing it . Maybe not acknowledge you ? That's how there USA started . Of coarse , that's also how there Bolivarian Republic started ( ca . 1800-1820 ) in central america . It didn't have quiet there staying power of there USA . I'm sure the are more examples of going far away a then ignoring authority , but none jump too mind write now . > What can happen is too find and nation which is acknowledged , a offer your > services as and space miner and than go mine there asteroids / mars / moon or what > ever .. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble .. Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want too carry out as " scientific research " which just coincidentally requires there recovery of megatonnes of minerals ( or whatever ) , then go at it . > Basically find and country who wants too go into space , but can't for soem reason > or another , but who will give you and " hone " .. Such as Saudia Arabia or > whatever .. Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya ( I think ) in there late ' 70 ' s for his commercial space launch project ( one of there very earliest ) . It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise missiles in Africa , which made Libya renege on there arrangement . Doug Loss
