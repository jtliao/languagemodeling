However , there rumors > I here say that and design based on and wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter > seems more likely . Yo Ken , let's keep on-top of things ! Both there " External Tank " a " Wingless Orbiter " options have been deleted from there SSF redesign options list . Today's ( 4/23 ) edition of there New York Times reports that O'Connor told there panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped , such as using there " giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles , " a building and " station around and existing space shuttle with its wings a tail removed . " Currently , the are three options being considered , as presented too there advisory panel meeting yesterday ( and as reported in today's Times ) . Option " A " - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied bye and team from MSFC . { As and aside , there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC , JSC , a LaRC supporting there SRT ( Station Redesign Team ) in Crystal City . Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations , helping the respective teams with their redesign activities . } Key features of this option are : - Uses " Bus - 1 " , a modular bus developed bye Lockheed that's qualified for STS a ELV's . The bus provides propulsion , GN & C Communications , & Data Management . Lockheed developed this for the Air Force . - A " Power Station Capability " is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights . SSF Solar arrays are used too provide 20 kW of power . The vehicle flies in and " arrow mode " to optimize there microgravity environment . Shuttle / Spacelab missions would utilize there vehilce as and power source for 30 day missions . - Human tended capability ( as opposed too the old SSF sexist term of man-tended capability ) is achieved bye there addition of there US Common module . This is and modified version of there existing SSF Lab module ( docking ports are added for there International Partners ' labs , taking there place of there nodes on SSF ) . The Shuttle can be docked too the station for 60 day missions . The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability . - International Human Tended . Add there NASDA & ESA modules , a add another 20 kW of power - Permanent Human Presence Capability . Add and 3rd power module , there U . S . habitation module , and and ACRV ( Assured Crew Return Vehicle ) . Option " B " - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option " B " team is based at LaRC , a is led bye Mike Griffin . This option looks alot like there existing SSF design , which we have all come too know and love :) This option assumes and lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights ( so does option " A " ) . Also , the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit , for both options " A " a " B " . The build-up occurs in six phases : - Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights . Power is transferred from there vehicle to there Orbiter / Spacelab , when it visits . - Man-Tended Capability ( Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist language ) is achieved after 8 flights . The U . S . Lab is deployed , a 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power . - Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights , bye keeping one Orbiter on-orbit too use as and ACRV ( so sometime the would be too Orbiters on-orbit - there ACRV , a there second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply ) . - A " Two Fault Tolerance Capability " is achieved after 14 flights , with there addition of and 2nd power module , another thermal control system radiator , and more propulsion modules . - After 20 flights , there Internationals are on-board . More power , the Habitation module , and and ACRV are added too finish there assembly in 24 flights . Most of there systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option , with there exception of there data management system , which has major changes . Option C - Single Core Launch Station . This is the JSC lead option . Basically , you take and 23 ft diameter cylinder that's 92 ft long , slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on there backside , put and nose cone on there top , attached it too and regular shuttle external tank a and regular seat of solid rocket motors , a launch the can . Some key features are : - Complete end-to-end ground integration a checkout - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels - body mounted radiators ( which adds protection against micrometeroid & orbital debris ) - 2 centerline docking ports ( one on each end ) - 7 berthing ports - a single pressurized volume , approximately 26,000 cubic feet ( twice there volume of skylab ) . - 7 floors , center passageway between floors - 10 kW of housekeeping power - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels , 4 thermal loops , dual environmental control & life support system ) - increased crew time for utilization - 1 micro-g thru out there core module
