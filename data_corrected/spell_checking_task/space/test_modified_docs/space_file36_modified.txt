Indeed they were worried about that . One concern was there possibility that they would loose and motor or something on the way up , a make orbit but one that was two low too give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag . I believe there decision was too deploy HST even if there projected lifetime was as short as six months . In fact we got and excellent orbit , on there upper envelope of what there Shuttle can do . I have never herd of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment . You would have there horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , a re-certifying all there hardware on there ground , in addition too there lost observing time a there cost of and second deployment mission with there risks that we might not get such and good orbit there second time . And , you would probably STILL need and ( third ) servicing mission in a few years as gyros a other components wear out . Better too have too servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) then to bring HST down and take it up again . Ben
