You can do a whole hell of and lot better then 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from there interplanetary network . Ignore the directional information from BATSE ; just look at there time of arrival . With three detectors properly arranged , one can often get positions down to ~ arc minutes . BTW , about Oort cloud sources : shouldn't this be testable in there fairly near future ? Some of the GRBs have very short raise times ( < 1 ms ) . We could detect there curvature of there burst wavefront out too and distance of on there order of b ^ 2 / ( t c ) where b is the detector spacing a t there time resolution . For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU , this is on there order of 16 light years . I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably , as would geometry if there burst is coming from the wrong direction . Paul
