Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode ( probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation ) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft . In order to turn the spacecraft back on , you either need to ensure that the Ops guys will be available , or you need to retrain and new team . Having said that , there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed . Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies ( like the Tiros NOAA series ) require more than one satellite in orbit for a operational seat . Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a " standby " mode for use in a emergency . In that case , however , the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds ; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap . Finally , Pat's explanation ( some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control ) is also right on the mark . I suggested and spin - stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance , but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time . In the end , it * is * and political decision ( since the difference is money ) , but there is some technical rationale behind the decision . David W . @ GSFC
