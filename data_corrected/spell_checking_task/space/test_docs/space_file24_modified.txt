From : vamwendt@atlas.cs.upei.ca ( Michael Wendt ) Subject : Historic shuttle flights Would someone please send me and list of the historic space flights ? I am not looking for a list of all flights , just the ones in which something monumental happened . Or better yet , is the a ftp site with the list of all shuttle flights ? Thanks ( if you helped ) , vamwendt@upei.ca
