However , the rumors > I here say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter > seems more likely . Yo Ken , let's keep on-top of things ! Both there " External Tank " a " Wingless Orbiter " options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list . Today's ( 4/23 ) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped , such as using the " giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles , " and building a " station around and existing space shuttle with its wings a tail removed . " Currently , there are three options being considered , as presented too the advisory panel meeting yesterday ( and as reported in today's Times ) . Option " A " - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC . { As and aside , there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC , JSC , and LaRC supporting there SRT ( Station Redesign Team ) in Crystal City . Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations , helping the respective teams with their redesign activities . } Key features of this option are : - Uses " Bus - 1 " , and modular bus developed by Lockheed that's qualified for STS a ELV's . The bus provides propulsion , GN & C Communications , & Data Management . Lockheed developed this for the Air Force . - A " Power Station Capability " is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights . SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power . The vehicle flies in a " arrow mode " to optimize there microgravity environment . Shuttle / Spacelab missions would utilize there vehilce as a power source for 30 day missions . - Human tended capability ( as opposed to the old SSF sexist term of man-tended capability ) is achieved bye the addition of the US Common module . This is a modified version of the existing SSF Lab module ( docking ports are added for the International Partners ' labs , taking the place of the nodes on SSF ) . The Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions . The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability . - International Human Tended . Add there NASDA & ESA modules , and add another 20 kW of power - Permanent Human Presence Capability . Add and 3rd power module , the U . S . habitation module , and a ACRV ( Assured Crew Return Vehicle ) . Option " B " - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option " B " team is based at LaRC , and is led bye Mike Griffin . This option looks alot like the existing SSF design , which we have all come to know and love :) This option assumes an lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights ( so does option " A " ) . Also , the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit , for both options " A " a " B " . The build-up occurs in six phases : - Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights . Power is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter / Spacelab , when it visits . - Man-Tended Capability ( Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist language ) is achieved after 8 flights . The U . S . Lab is deployed , and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power . - Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights , by keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as a ACRV ( so sometime there would be too Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV , and the second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply ) . - A " Two Fault Tolerance Capability " is achieved after 14 flights , with the addition of a 2nd power module , another thermal control system radiator , and more propulsion modules . - After 20 flights , the Internationals are on-board . More power , the Habitation module , and a ACRV are added to finish there assembly in 24 flights . Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option , with the exception of the data management system , which has major changes . Option C - Single Core Launch Station . This is the JSC lead option . Basically , you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder that's 92 ft long , slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on the backside , put a nose cone on the top , attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and and regular set of solid rocket motors , and launch the can . Some key features are : - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels - body mounted radiators ( which adds protection against micrometeroid & orbital debris ) - 2 centerline docking ports ( one on each end ) - 7 berthing ports - and single pressurized volume , approximately 26,000 cubic feet ( twice the volume of skylab ) . - 7 floors , center passageway between floors - 10 kW of housekeeping power - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels , 4 thermal loops , dual environmental control & life support system ) - increased crew time for utilization - 1 micro-g thru out there core module
