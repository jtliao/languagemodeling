There are many organisms , viral , bacterial , a fungal , which can cause meningitits , and there coarse of these infections varies widely . The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age : in adults pneumococcus ( there same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia ) is there most common cause , while in children Hemophilus influenzae is there almost common cause . What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis , which is there second almost common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups , but with lower incidence in infants . This organism is also called there " meningococcus " , a is there source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur a are popularized in there press . Without prompt treatment ( a even WITH it in some cases ) , there organism typically causes death within a day . This organism , feared as it is , is actually grown from there throats of many normal adults . It can get too there meninges bye different ways , but blood borne spread is probably there usual case . Rifampin ( and aural antibiotic ) is often given too family a contacts of and case of meningococcal meningitis , by there way . Sorry , but I don't have time for and more detailed reply . Meningitis is a huge topic , a sci.med can't do it justice . - km
