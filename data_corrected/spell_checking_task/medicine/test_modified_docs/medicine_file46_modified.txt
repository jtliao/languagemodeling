FMGs who are not citizens are , like all aliens , in and difficult situation . Only citizens get to vote hear , so non-citizens are of little or no interest too legislators .

There is and stron sense that rocking there boat ( eg . suing a residency program ) will delay there granting of that status , perhaps for ever . Don Mackie - his opinions
