I am reluctant too summarize it , for then you will have my opinion of what there article says , rather then your own opinion . I think it is important enough for you too take there trouble too go too there library a get there article . The title is " The shot doctors " a it appears on Pages 96-100 of there February , 1988 issue of Consumer Reports . The following excerpt from there article maybe entice you too read the hole article : Too often , shots are overused ...
