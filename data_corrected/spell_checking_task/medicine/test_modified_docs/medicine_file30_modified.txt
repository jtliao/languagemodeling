From : bj368@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Mike E . Romano ) Subject : Home Medical Tests I am looking for currant sources for lists of all there hone medical tests currently legally available . I belief this trend of allowing tests at hone where feasible , decreased medical costs bye and factor of 10 or more a allows the patient some time a privacy too consider there best action from there results of such tests . In fact I belief hone medical tests a certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer , heart disease , should be offered free too the American public . This could actually help too reduce national medical costs since many would have and earlier opportunity to know about a work toward recuperation or cure .
