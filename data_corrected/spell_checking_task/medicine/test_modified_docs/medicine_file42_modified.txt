About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax , probably as and result of too much headphone use . Anyway , there clinic that cleaned them out used there following procedure : 1 . Inject olive oil into ears . 2 . Prevent leakage of oil with cotton . 3 . Come back in and hour . 4 . Rinse ears with warm vater , forcefully injected into ear ( very strange sensation ) . 5 . Done . They had special tools too do this , and were evidently quiet familiar with the problem : Very large steel syringe . Special bowl with cutout for ear too take the grime coming out without spillage . > Good Luck Seconded , Bjorn R . Bjornsson brb@falcon.is
