You'd have too purify there river water first . I'm not sure how practical that is with there Mississippi . You'd better check with health agencies along there way too see if the are toxic chemicals in there river . If it is just microorganisms , dozens can be filtered or killed , but you may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals . Better be same then sorry . Obviously , drinking the river without processing it is likely too make you sick from bacteria a parasites . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is the chastity of there intellect , a geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful too surrender it two soon .
