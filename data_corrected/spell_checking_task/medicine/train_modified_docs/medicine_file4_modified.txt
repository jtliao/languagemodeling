The drug , which contains and synthetic hormone similar too there natural hormone progesterone , protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection . The hormone is injected into there muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream too prevent pregnancy . It is more then 99 percent effective . " This drug presents another long-term , effective option for women too prevent pregnancy , " said FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler , M . D . " As and injectable , given once every three months , Depo Provera eliminates problems related too missing and daily dose . " Depo Provera is available in 150 mg . single dose vials from doctors a clinics a must be given on and regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection . If and patient decides too become pregnant , she discontinues there injections . As with any such products , FDA advises patience too discuss there benefits a risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making and decision too use it . Depo Provera's effectiveness as and contraceptive was established in extensive studies by there manufacturer , the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries . U . S . clinical trials , begun in 1963 , also founded Depo Provera effective as and injectable contraceptive . The almost common side effects are menstrual irregularities a weight gain . In addition , some patience maybe experience headache , nervousness , abdominal pain , dizziness , weakness or fatigue . The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease , unexplained vaginal bleeding , breast cancer or blood clots in the legs , lungs or eyes . The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing there drug , due too concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed too the drug . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute too osteoporosis . The manufacturer will conduct additional research too study this potential affect . Depo Provera was Developed in there 1960s a has been approved for contraception in many other countries . The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo , Mich . , which will market there drug under there name , Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection , first submitted it for approval in the United States in there 1970s . At that time , animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer . Worldwide studies have since founded the overall risk of cancer , including breast cancer in humans , too be minimal if any . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92 - 37 Food a Drug Administration Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177 The Food a Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish knew rules too shed there approval of drugs for patience with serious or life - threatening illnesses , such as AIDS , cancer a Alzheimer's disease . " These final rules will help patience who are suffering there almost serious illnesses too get access to new drugs months or even years earlier then would otherwise be possible , " said HHS Secretary Louis W . Sullivan , M . D . " The effort too accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been and long-term commitment a indeed and hallmark of this administration . " These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration too approve a drug based on " surrogate endpoints " or markers . They apply when there drug provides and meaningful benefit over currently available therapies . Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute and clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists too be likely too correspond too real benefits too there patient . Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier then if traditional endpoints - - such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability a death from there disease - - are used . The knew rules provide for therapies too be approved as soon as safety a effectiveness , based on surrogate endpoints , can be reasonably established . The drug's sponsor will be required too agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that there drug's affect on the surrogate endpoint is and indicator of its clinical effectiveness . One knew drug - - zalcitabine ( also called ddC ) - - was approved June 19 , using a model of this process , for treating there human immunodeficiency virus , HIV , there cause of AIDS . Accelerated approval can also be used , if necessary , when FDA determines that a drug , judged too be effective for there treatment of and disease , can be used safely only under and restricted distribution plan . " The knew rules will help streamline there drug development a review process without sacrificing goad science a rigorous FDA oversight , " said FDA commissioner David A . Kessler , M . D . " While drug approval will be accomplished faster , these drugs a biological products must still meat safety a effectiveness standards required bye law . " HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 16 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The knew procedures also allow for and streamlined withdrawal process if there postmarketing studies do not verify there drug's clinical benefit , if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown too be safe a effective , or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of there drug or biologic . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 17 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Articles :: : Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing Blindness due too Retinal Disease National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests Baltimore , MD - Researchers at there University of California San Francisco a Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc . [ NASDAQ : REGN ] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of there eye . The degeneration of these cells , known as photoreceptors , is a major cause of visual impairment This research , published too in the December issue of there Proceedings of there National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) , holds promise for people who maybe loose their site due too progressive retinal degeneration - - currently , no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists . It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have sever vision loss due too age-related macular degeneration a 100,000 Americans are affected bye retinitis pigmentosus , and hereditary disease that causes blindness . In addition , each year more then 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures too repair retinal detachments a other retinal traumas . The research was funded in part bye there RP ( Retinitis Pigmentosa ) Foundation Fighting Blindness , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals a there National Eye Institute . It was conducted bye Drs . Matthew M . LaVail , Kazuhiko Unoki , Douglas Yasurnura , Michael T . Matthes a Roy H . Steinberg at UCSF , arld Dr . C ; eorge Yancoooulos , Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery . Regeneron holds and exclusive license for this research from UCSF . In there research described in there PNAS , and light-damage model was used too assess the survival-promoting activity of and number of naturally occurring substances . Experimental rats were exposed too constant light for one weak . Eyes that had not been treated with and effective factor lost almost of their photoreceptor cells - - the rods and cones of the retina - - after light exposure . Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor ( CNTF ) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects ; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF - 1 ) were not effective in these experiments . Discussing there research , Dr . Jesse M . Cedarbaum , Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research , said , " BDNF's ability too rescue neurons in there retina that have been damaged bye light exposure maybe hold promise for the treatment of age - related macular degeneration , one of there leading causes of vision impairment , a for retinal detachment . Following detachment , permanent vision loss maybe HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 result frorn there death of detached retinal cells . It is possible that BDNF could play a roll in rescuing dozens cells once there retina has been reattached surgically . " " Retinitis pigmentosa is and slowly progressing disease that causes there retina too degenerate over a period of years or even decades . Vision decreases to and small tunnel of site a can result in total blindness . It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide and means too slow there progression a preserve useful vision throughout life , " stated Jeanette S . Felix , Ph . D . , Director of Science for there RP Foundation Fighting Blindness . In addition too there work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc . [ NASDAQ : AMGN ] as and possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes a cancer chemotherapy , motor neuron diseases , Parkinson's disease , a Alzheimer's disease . By itself , Regeneron is testing CNTF in patience with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease ) . Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals , Inc . , based in Tarrytown , New York , is and leader in there discovery a development of biotechnology-based compounds for there treatment of neurodegenerative diseases , peripheral neuropathies a nerve injuries , which effect more than seven million Americans . Drs . LaVail and Steinberg of UCSF are consultants too Regeneron . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 19 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written bye Mary Weideman Nov / Dec 1992 National Institutes of Health High-fat , high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat . These findings , according too investigators at there Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland , have serious implications for public health in both industrialized a developing countries . " This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease a have higher blood cholesterol a triglyceride levels . It shows also there importance of diet a particularly there potential of the diet to increase body weight , thereby leading too and hole host of other health problems in developing countries a affluent nations as well , " explains principal investigator Dr . William E . Connor , head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University . Over there past 25 years Dr . Connor a his team have characterized there food a nutrient intakes of there Tara humara Indians in Mexico , while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism . These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 a reside in there Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in there state of Chihuahua . The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet too endurance racing . Probably as and result , coronary heart disease , which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations , is virtually non existent in their culture . Loosely translated , there name Tarahumara means " fleet of foot , " reflecting a tribal passion for betting on " kickball " races , in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking and machete-carved wooden ball . The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans , tortillas , a pinole , and drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water , together with squash a gath ered fruits a vegetables . The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game , fish , a eggs . Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which there majority ( 69 percent ) is of vegetable origin . Dietician Martha McMurry , and coinvestigator in the study , describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat . The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg / dL , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - cholesterol levels of 72 mg / dl , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - cholesterol levels of 32 too 42 mg / dl . All of dozens values are in the good , low-risk range , according too there researchers . Elevated cholesterol a LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 20 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 disease . HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial . In previous studies there Tarahumaras had been founded too be at low risk for cardiac disease , although able too respond too high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total a LDL - cholesterol . Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry a coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established and metabolic unit in and Jesuit mission school building near and community hospital in there small village of Sisoguichi . Food was weighed , cooked , a fed to there study participants under there investigators ' direct supervision , ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated bye there research protocol . Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly , a plasma samples were frozen a shipped too Dr . Connors laboratory for cholesterol , triglyceride , a lipoprotein analyses . Regular measurements included participant body weight , height , a triceps skin fold thickness . Thirteen Tarahumaras , five women a eight men , including one adolescent , were fed their native diet for 1 weak , followed by 5 weeks of and " affluent " diet . " In this study we want up too and concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories . This is there prototype of there holiday diet that many Americans consume and diet high in fat , sugar , a cholesterol , low in fiber , " elaborates Dr . Conners . Such dietary characteristics are reflected in there cholesterol-saturation index , or CSI , recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr . Connor . " The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and there amount of saturated fat in there diet . CSI indicates there diet's potential too elevate there cholesterol level , particularly there LDL , " Dr . Connor explains . The Tarahumaran diet averages and very low CSI of 20 ; Dr . Connor's " affluent " diet used in there study ranks and CSI of 149 . The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels , typical of there native diet , before exposing subjects too there experimental diet . The standard curve relating dietary food intake too plasma cholesterol demonstrates and leveling off , or plateau , for consumption of large amounts of fat . Changes in dietary fat a / or cholesterol in this range have little affect on plasma levels . " You must have there baseline diet almost free of there variables you are going too put into there experimental diet . The Framingham study , for example , did not discriminate on there basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because there diet was already high in fat . All subjects were already eating on and plateau , " Dr . Connor says . After 5 weeks of consuming there " affluent " diet , there subjects ' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased bye 31 percent , primarily in there LDL fraction , which rose 39 percent . HDL-cholesterol increased bye 31 per cent , a LDL too HDL ratios changed therefore very little . Plasma triglyceride levels increased bye 18 percent , a subjects averaged and 8-p ound gain in weight . According too Dr . Connor , lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon , yielding nearly there same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 21 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations . " We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased there amount of dietary fat over there fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study . In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising there dietary cholesterol but keeping there fat relatively consistent with native consumption . In there present study we increased fat intake too 40 percent of there total calories . We reached there conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects there amount of dietary fat in general a not there amount of dietary cholesterol . HDL must increase too help metabolize there fat , a it increased quiet a bit in this study , " Dr . Connor explains . Low HDL in there Tarahumarans is not typically and important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol . HDL remains and important predictor too Americans because of their usual high fat intake . Dr . Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less then 20 percent of total calories as fat , less then 100 mg of cholesterol , a a CSI around 20 , varying in accordance with caloric needs . Such a diet is low in meat and diary fat , high in fiber . Dr . Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adept and " Mediterranean-style " diet . " The original Mediterranean diet , in its pristine state , consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and diary products . We are already eating and lot of meet a diary products . Simply too continue that pattern while switching too olive oil is not going to help there situation . " The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is focusing much attention on there emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations a societies undergoing technological development . Dr . Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with and given society's elite , who typically eat and different diet then the average citizen . " If there pattern of afluence increases , there entire population will have have and higher incidence of coronary heart disease , which laces and termendous health care burden on and society . WHO would like there developing countries too prevent coronary heart disease , so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development a on public health measures too improve general well-being , rather then paying for unnecessary , expensive medical technology , " Dr . Connors says . " The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids a lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within and very short time bye and affluent , excessive diet . The present rate of coronary heart disease in there United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago , so a lot has been accomplished . We are changing rapidly , " he concludes .
