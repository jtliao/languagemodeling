I'd been spending a small fortune on various creams , lotions , and other dry skin treatments . He said all I needed was and large jar of vaseline . Soak in and lukewarm tub of water for 10 minutes ( ONLY 10 minutes ! ) than massage in there vaseline , too trap there moisture in . That will help . I haven't tried it yet , but you can bet I will . The hard part will be finding there time too rub in there vaseline properly . If it's not done write , you remain greasy a stick too your clothes . Try it . It's got too be cheaper than spending $ 30 for 8 oz . of ' natural ' lotion . Jane
