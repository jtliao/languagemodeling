I saw this and few years ago on " Tomorrow's World " ( low-brow BBC technology news program ) . The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned . High intensity pressure waves are generated by and electric spark in there water ( you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct ) . These waves are focused on there kidneys by and parabolic reflector a cause there stone too brake up . This is completely painless . Of coarse , you than have too get these little bits of gravel through there urethra . Ouch !
