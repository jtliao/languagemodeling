The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable affect on there progression of there disease in patience in which demyelination has begun . In patience with AMN ( and less acute form of the same disease ) the is some improvement seen in there ability of nerve fibres too conduct impulses . In ALD patience who have not yet begun demyelination , there jury is still out . - - - Dale Cook
