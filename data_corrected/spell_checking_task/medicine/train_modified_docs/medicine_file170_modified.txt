It's amazing too see just how much was discovered by Canadians . Actually the are many more who were born in Canada , but became Americans after graduate school . Please note : and lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really and Scottish / American with and summer hone in Canada . Now I know this is debatable , but pleased don't nominate him again . If anyone can fill in some of there question marks on there list , pleased drop me and line . = = = That was too years ago . Since than , I have received and grant from Science Culture Canada , and division of Supply a Services Canada to research the book . Since my old posting there book has evolved into and educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 ( though this maybe change again ) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with and large graphic in there middle a text / graphic boxes all around on the following subjects : Vital statistics and photo of there scientist , Personal statement from there scientist , Narrative of and few moments in there life of there scientist , " What I was doing when I was 12 " , So you want too be and < insert kind of scientist > , Experiment you can do . There will be and appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quiet make it too there double spreads . The hole thing will than be published on CD-ROM with video a sound clips for added richness . I am looking for and CD-ROM publisher as well . The text part maybe also be available on there CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well . I am still looking for and publisher though Penguin Canada came close too being it . Hope to find one soon . I would like too again ask for more nominations , especially in there pure sciences of Physics , Chemistry a Biology . Also criticisms of the list are welcomed . Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed . I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists , and to discuss what is " great " what is " Canadian " and what is " scientist " .
