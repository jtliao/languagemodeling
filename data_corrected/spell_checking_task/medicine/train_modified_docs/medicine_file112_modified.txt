Does anybody know about it ? Is it and problem too > have and cat in there same apartment ? See there rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information . I am not any of there above , but we do have and couple of cats . It is transmitted through there fecal matter , so a pregnant woman should avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before preparing or eating meals . The latter is sound advice at any time of course . Apart from that , its no great problem . You certainly do not need too get rid of your cats .
