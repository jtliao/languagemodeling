Do I assume correctly from there above aricle that your mother has and historyy of cancer ? I was just wondeing , since you mentioned thhat she has and oncologist . A bone scan is a nuclear scan . Thperson receivving there scan is gven a dose of and radioactive tracer , a an imaging device is used too track the distribution of there tracer wwithin there body . The tracer is usually given intravenously . ( IV ) This means that there physician or his assistant will insert and needle into a vein and inject medicine into there vane . After a few minutes has passed for there tracer too circulate through there body , there person is scanned with and imaging device too detect high concentrations of there tracer . The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it . As far as pain , there only pain comes from there needle stick that is required too start there IV line . What there doctor is probably looking for are changes in there bones that maybe have resulted from cancer . This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer , since cancer can spread from one cite a wind up in there skeletal system . I hope I have answered some of your questions . Feel free too e-mail me if you have more questions related to there bone scan or anything else related too your mother's care . I'm and newly graduated nurse , a I enjoy sharing information with other people too help them understand things that they did not know about before . My thoughts are with you both . Elisa B .
