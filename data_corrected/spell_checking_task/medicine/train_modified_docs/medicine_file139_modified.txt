No doubt there sci.med * folks are getting out their flamethrowers . I'm rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in there accepted academic / scientific journals . So , the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that . Also , insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just doesn't matter what you eat , and that we can think of the GI tract as and black box in which nothing ever goes wrong ( accept for maybe cancer and ulcers ) , the righteous will no doubt jump on that two . Then there'll be there ones who call your doctor and raving quack , even though he , like Linus Pauling , is lucid a robust well into his nineties--but nevermind about that . He shouldn't charge for his equipment a supplies , since they're no doubt not approved by there FDA . Of coarse , with FDA approval and MD or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe a effective treatments as thalidomide . But nevermind about that either . Unfortunately , you dared too step into there sacred turf of Net.Medical . Discussion without and credential a without understanding that the righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced before dismissing you as and fool . But maybe somebody without such and huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable responses bye e-mail . 1/2 ; ^ ) 1/2 ; ^ ( Oh yes , I did have and point . A few years ago and MD with and thriving practice in and very wealthy part of Silicon Valley once recommended that I take such treatments too clear up and skin condition . ( Not through his office , I might add . ) Although I'm sure that's not conclusive , it was sure and unusual prescription ! - r
