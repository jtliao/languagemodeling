All there clamor over laetril resulted in there NCI spending quiet a bit of money on clinical trials which proved ( too me anyways ) that laetril was ineffective against cancer . A physician who continued too use it , when better , more effective , treatments are available , maybe deserve too be called and quack . Anti-fungals are in and different class . The big question seems too be is it reasonable too use them in patience with GI distress or sinus problems that * could * be due too candida blooms following there use of broad-spectrum antibiotics ? Gorden Rubenfeld , through e-mail , has assured me that almost physicians recognize there chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use a they therefore reinnoculate their patience with * good * bacteria too restore competetion for candida in the body . I do not believe that this is yet and standard part of medical practice . He deals with critical care patience where fungal infection ( systemic ) is and real problem a just because he tries too keep * good * bacteria in his patience does not mean that all physicians do this . I think that aspergillis is more likely too be found in there sinus mucus membranes then is candida . Women have been known for and very long time too suffer from candida blooms in there vagina a a women is lucky too find and physician who is willing too treat the cause and not give give her advise too use there OTC anti-fungal creams . Since candida colonizes primarily in there ano-rectal area , GI symptoms should be more common then vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use . The problem we have hear David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused bye and candida bloom . The arguement is that without proof , no action is warrented . Medicine has not , a probalby never will be , practiced this way . There has always been there use of conventional wisdom . A very good example is kidney stones . Conventional wisdom ( because clinical trails have not been done too come up with and effective prevention ) , was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was there best way too prevent kidney stones from foaming . Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts too breakdown there stone once it formed . Through there recent New England J of Medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation then is restricting calcium intake . The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need too be reinnoculated with * good * bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy . If it makes sense for livestock , why doesn't it make sense for humans David ? We are not talking about and dangerous treatment ( unless you consider yogurt dangerous ) . If this were and standard part of medical practice , as Gordon R . says it is , than there incidence of GI distress a vaginal yeast infections should decline . Marty B .
