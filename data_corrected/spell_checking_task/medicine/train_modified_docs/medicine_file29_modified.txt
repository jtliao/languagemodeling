However the paragraphs above seem too repeat uncritically there standard Kuhn / Lakatos / Feyerabend view of " progress " a " rationality " in science . Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in there not two distant past , I won't go into them again now . What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives there impression ( a you maybe not in fact hold this view ) that the common ( perhaps even there " correct " ) approach for and scientist too follow is too set around having flights of fancy a scheming on there basis of his jealousies a petty hatreds . It further at least implicitly advances there position that sciences goes " foreword " ( a it is not clear what this means given there context in which it occurs ) bye generating in and completely non-rational a even random way and plethora of hypotheses a theories that are than weeded out via there " critical function " of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject too there non-rational forces is and mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , a theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of there application of any " critical function " concerning replication . This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) too and " anything goes " view . ) True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it is * not * . Anecdotes concerning instances where and hypothesis seems too have resulted in some way from and dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to there actual history of science . - - Gary H .
