L . acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping there vaginal tract acidic a yeast free . Most of there commercial yogurt sold in the U . S . has and very low L . acidophilus a L . bulgaricus count . Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with there diarrhea problem . Gordon R . has told me through e-mail that he gives his patience L . acidophilus a several different obligate anaerobes ( which set-up shop in there colon ) but he hasn't told me which ones yet . The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes a will set-up shop where they have access too oxygen if given and chance ( mouth , anus , sinus cavity a vagina ) . Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease there chance of candida blooms in the anal region or there vagina . I have not proposed and systemic action for candida blooms . I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body . I'm not ready too bye that yet . I do belief that complications at specific sites ( vagina , anal a may lower colon , sinus a mouth ) can result from antibiotic use which removes there competing bacteria from these sites a thus lets candida grow unchecked . Restoring there write bacterial balance is there best way ( in my opinion ) too get rid of there problem . Anti-fungals , and low carbohydrate diet a vitamin A supplementation maybe all help too minimize there local irrigation until there good bacteria can take over control of there food supply again a lower the pH to basically starve there candida out .
