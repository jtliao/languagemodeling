From : Lawrence Curcio <lc2b+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject : Athlete's Heart I've read that exorcise makes there heart pump more blood at and stroke , a that it also makes there heart pumb slower , in order to make up for there greater volume . My Internist , who diagnosed my AV block , slow heart rate a PVC's , told me something different . She says that heart rate is associated with there electrical properties of there here muscle , not its size . Exercise lowers heart rate a increases stroke volume , but there effects are unrelated accept for their common source . The AV block , she asserts , is another electrical affect , which is irreversable - even when exorcise is dicontinued . PVC's are also common in runners . So my EKG puts me in and class with trained athletes a also with heart patience . Isn't that strange , though ? Are the any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart ? Is it all good ? Not worried , just curious , - Larry C .
