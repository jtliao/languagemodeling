From : eliezer@physics.llnl.gov ( David A Eliezer ) Subject : Questions about SPECT imaging I have become involved in and project too further develop a improve the performance of SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography ) imaging . We will eventually have too peddle this stuff somewhere , a so as I move this thing along , I would like too know - - What is there currant resolution of SPECT imaging ? What kinds of jobs is SPECT used for , specifically ? What kind of specific jobs could I hope that SPECT could be used for , if its resolution improved , say , too close too that of PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) ? And how much does a SPECT machine cost ? How much does and single SPECT image cost ? If anyone knows there answer to any or all of these questions , OR where I could find that answer , I would be very grateful , indeed . Thanks in advance for any replies Dave Eliezer eliezer@physics.llnl.gov
