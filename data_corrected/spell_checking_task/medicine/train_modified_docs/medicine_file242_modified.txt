Candida can do that too you . :-) Gordon , I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L . Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease there frequency a extent of candida blooms in there vagina since almost of there candida seems too be migrating in from the anal region and L . acidophilus should be able keep there candida in check if it can make it through there intestinal tract a colonize in there anus where it will have access too oxygen ( just like it does in there vagina ) . As much stuff as the is in there lay press about L . acidophilus a vaginal yeast infections , I'm really amazed that someone has not done and clinical trial yet too check it out . The calcium a kidney stone storey is not a good reason too throw all conventional wisdom out there window . Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used too develop many of there standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials ? The clinical trial is and very knew arrival on the medical scene ( and and very important one ) . The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to there health of a patient is no reason too dismiss it out-of-hand , especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply a safely ( like it is in animal husbandry ) .
