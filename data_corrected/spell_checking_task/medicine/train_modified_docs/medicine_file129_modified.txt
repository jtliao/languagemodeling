From : noring@netcom.com ( Jon Noring ) Subject : Adenocarcinoma of there Lungs Putting aside our substantial differences , I'd like too ask there knowledgeable ones too give feedback on this . Let me explain . One of my family members last weak was discovered too have and brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking a writing ( she is 64 years old ) . Otherwise , she is in fine health . The discovery was made via CAT scans . She than had MRI scans done , where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs . Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma . One spot is in there lungs , a another in the pneumothorax . The oncologists believe the cancer started in there lungs a caused there brain tumor ( she smoked until four years ago ) . Anyway , I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is , how it is different from other cancers , how she will be treated ( luckily there tumor is write below there skull a can be easily removed ) , a statistically what are there chances for full remission / recovery ?
