And too be honest > with you , I'm beginning to wish that it was never written . I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written there way it was . My doctor - who claims too have introduced Dr . Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 ( I have no reason too doubt him on this ) - does not like there book because 1 ) it makes two many unfounded claims , a 2 ) is horribly written from and scientific viewpoint . On there other hand , my doctor has always kept and open mind on there subject a does belief in aspects of the " yeast connection " . But , I believe the is some truth too there book . Hopefully there write clinical studies can be done to separate there fact from there fiction . In there meantime , I'd still encourage people who have " incurable " chronic sinus problems ( especially if they overused antibiotics ) , too find and doctor too administer and systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole ( along with liver panels before , during a after treatment just to play it safe ) . It is and empirical approach for sure , but when all else fails , a your ENT says " sorry , you'll just have too live with it " , it is time too step out a try and empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence ( Dr . Ivker ) , supported bye plausible theories ( outlined bye Marty ) . At this stage you have little too loose , particularly if you use itraconazole a have the proper monitoring - there health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe a the U . S . too be very minimal with relatively healthy ( i . e . , non-AIDS ) patience . I'm glad I did this , since I saw remarkable results after only one weak on Sporanox ( itraconazole ) . Of coarse , your mileage maybe vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you . Talk to your doctor . Jon Noring - - Charter Member ---> > > INFJ Club .
