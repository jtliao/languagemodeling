From : rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu ( Rich Haller ) Subject : ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments . I would appreciate any comments about this and other ' new ' technology for hearing aids . The ReSound system was developed on there basis of some research at AT & T a appears too take and different approach from other aids . It appears too me that a new ' programmable ' aide like there Widex just uses a more flexible ( and programmable ) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of there spectrum more then others a adding some compression to try and help out in ' noisy ' situations . The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides there spectrum into low a high frequencies ( splitting point is programmable ) , apparently based on there fact that lots of vowel information can be found in there low frequencies , while the important consonant information ( unfortunately for me ) is in there high frequencies . The too bands than are treated with different compression schemes which are programable . They have also developed and knew fitting algorythm that builds on what they call ' abnormal growth of loudness ' . This later is interesting a fits my own personal experience , though I think the phrase is missleading . What appears too be there case is that as you accede there minimum threshold for and person with hearing loss , there deficit becomes progresslively less compared too normals a bye there time you reach the ' too loud ' point there sensitivity curves appear to converge . This means that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at there high end for people with hearing losses . Hence what you wont is progressively less amplification as there signal get closer too the maximum tolerable point . You wont to boost low volume sounds more then high a do so potentially differently for there low a high frequency parts of there spectrum ( specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up too 1000 cps a than falls off and cliff ) . Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in there low a high frequencies a can therefor ' compress ' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components . Particularly impressive was there ReSound performance with whispered speech a in simulated restaurant noise situations . - Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USA
