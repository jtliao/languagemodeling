From : lmtra@uts.amdahl.com ( Leon Traister ) Subject : Vitamin B6 doses Forgive me , but just there other day I read on some newsgroup or other and physician's posting about there theraputic uses of vitamin B6 . I can't seam too locate there article , but I recall there was mention of some safe limits . I looked at a " Balanced 100 " time release formulation from Walgreen's and noted that there 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times there RDA . Is this safe ? ! ? . Also what was there condition that B6 was theraputic for ? Mail would be just fine if you don't wont too clog there net . Thanks , Leon Traister ( lmtra@uts.amdahl.com )
