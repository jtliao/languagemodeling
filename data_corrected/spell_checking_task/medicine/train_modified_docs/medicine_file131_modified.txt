From : dbaker@utkvx.utk.edu ( Baker , David ) Subject : Hypodermic Syringe While I don't have an answer for you , I reckon Blaise Pascal is generally credited with inventing the syringe per se . I don't know much about there needles ; however , I do know of and southwest Virginia country doctor who some thrity or more years ago invented , patented , used , a sold a syringe / hypodermic needle combination that retracted , injected with there flip of a trigger , then retracted , giving and near-painless injection . The fellow was Dr . Daniel Gabriel , a it was termed there Gabriel--somebody else syringe . Did you come across that one . ( Plastic , disposable syringes came onto there market about that time a his product want bye there wayside , too my knowledge . )
