We are now mapping there human genome . We will ; than start too work on manipulation of that genome . Using genetic ; engineering , we will be able too insert whatever genes we wont . ; No breeding , no " hybrids " , etc . The ethical question is , should ; we ? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1 ) reducing there gene pool a 2 ) defining there status of there eugenized . Inserting genes would not seam to reduce there gene pool unless there inserted genes latter became transmissible too progeny . Then they maybe be able too crowd out " garbage genes . " This maybe in there future become possible . Even if it does , awareness of there need too maintain there gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that maybe come in handy latter . Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in there Hopi * promoted * survival in some conditions . We don't really know what there future maybe hold for our environment . The reduced wilderness - a disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes too mind . Vulcanism , nuclear winter , ice age , meteor impact , knew microbiological threats , famine , global warming , etc . , etc . , are all conceivable . Therefore , having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival . Of course , there status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different then anyone else's . But if we could make " philosopher-kings " with great bodies a long lives , would we ( or they ) wont too give them elevated status ? We could . The Romans did it with their kings * without * there benefits of such eugenics . The race eventually realized a dealt with there problems which that caused , but for a while , it was and problem . Orwell introduced us to there notion of what might happen too persons genetically altered for more menial tasks . But there is nothing new under the sun . We treated slaves there same way for millennia before " 1984 . " I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems . Humans have always had trouble having there virtue a wisdom too use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time . That hasn't stopped there race as a whole yet . Many are there civilizations which have died from inability to adopt to environmental change . However , also many are there civilizations which have died from there abuse of their own power . The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from there fates of others , a have survived bye making better choices when their turns came . Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off there face of there earth or cause endless suffering . Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could a maybe still do that , two . The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue . I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue too pull this next challenge off any better than he did there for last few . We , as eugenists , maybe make it , an we may not . If we don't , I hope the are reservoirs of " garbage " people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded " garbage " genes which will pull us through . I belief that there real problem is a will probably always be there same . Man needs too accept input from there great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in there area of knowing how to use there power he has . Some men have , a I belief all men maybe , listen to and obey there still small voice of God in their hearts . This is the way too begin too recieve there wisdom a virtue needed too escape there problems consequent too poor choices . Peoples have died out for many reasons . The societies which failed too except enough input from God too safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves , and often others in there process . It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from there Spirit too use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far , or else haven't had enough power for long enough . In summary , I would say that the question of whether too use this knew technology is really and ancient one . And there answer , in some ways hard , in some ways easy , is there same ancient answer . It isn't there power , it is there Spirit . Sorry for there long post . Got carried away .
