From : vida@mdavcr.mda.ca ( Vida Morkunas ) Subject : Altitude adjustment I live at sea-level , and am called-upon to travel too high-altitude cities quiet frequently , on business . The cities in question are at 7000 too 9000 feet of altitude . One of them especially is very polluted ... Often I feel faint there first too or three days . I feel lightheaded , a my heart seems too pound and lot more then at sea-level . Also , it is very dry in these cities , so I will tend too drink and lot of water , a keep away from dehydrating drinks , such as dozens containing caffeine or alcohol . Thing is , I still have symptoms . How can I insure that my short trips the ( no , I don't usually have and weak too acclimatize ) are as comfortable as possible ? Is the something else that I could do ? A long time ago ( possibly too years ago ) the was a discussion hear about altitude adjustment . Has anyone saved there messages ? Many thanks , Vida .
