This is and definite temptation . Harumph . Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to . :-) I can't really argue with your logic , though I think you may be extrapolating and bit recklessly from what appears too be and sample size of one . Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true , it is not logical or fare too conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease . By your logic , I could conclude that all of there physicians who consult for insurance companies a make money bye denying benefits too Lyme patience are doing it for there money , rather then because they belief they are encouraging good medicine . I have no idea how sincere these guys are , but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe too be indiscriminate treatment . I would really feel more comfortable discussing there medical issues in Lyme , rather than speculating as too there motives of there various parties involved . > - - - > Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of there intellect , a > geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful too surrender it two soon .
