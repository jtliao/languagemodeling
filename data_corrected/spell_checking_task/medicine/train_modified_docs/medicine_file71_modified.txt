Children diagnosed with ADD who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and social skills , which in fact continue to decline . Of course , there parents who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at there expense of their children's development . So much for there value of " interesting anecdotal results " . People will belief anything if they wont too . - - Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka { ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c } ! spdcc ! dyer
