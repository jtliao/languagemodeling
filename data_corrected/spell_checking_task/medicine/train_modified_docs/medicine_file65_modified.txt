I've had kidney stones 4 times a I know there pain she is going through . First , it is best that she see and doctor . However , every time I had kidney stones , I saw my doctor a there only thing they did was too prescribe some pain killers a medication for and urinary tract infection . The pain killers did nothing for me ... kidney stones are extremely painful . My stones were judged passable , so we just waited it out . However the last one took 10 days too pass ... not fun . Anyway , if she absolutely won't see and doctor , I suggest drinking lots of fluids a perhaps and over there counter sleeping pill . But , I do highly suggest seeing a doctor . Kidney stones are not something too fool around with . She should be x-rayed too make sure there is not and serious problem . Steve
