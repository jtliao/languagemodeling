From : Pat Lydon <pat@netmanage.com> Subject : HELP ... REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS I am writing this too find out there following : 1 . ) Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis . 2 . ) The name ( s ) of a doctor ( s ) who specialize in such surgery . 3 . ) Information on reflux esophagitis which leads too cancer . My boyfriend , age 34 a otherwise in good health , was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis a and hiatal hernia about 2 years ago . At that time he saw and gastroenterologist a has tried acid controllers ( Mylanta , Tagamet ) , as well as and restricted diet a raising there head of his bed . These treatments were not effective a because there damage was worsening , he opted for and surgical repair 3 months ago . He was told the were too repair techniques that could fix there problem ; and Nissen wrap a a " Hill Repair " . He opted for there " Hill Repair " . He recovered very well from there surgery itself but there pain he had originally is worse a in addition he now has trouble swallowing ( including saliva ) . The doctor now wants too do an endoscopy and has also informed him that and biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called " Barrett's Syndrome " . If he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer ? Basically , if anyone has any information on what he should do now , I'd appreciate it .
