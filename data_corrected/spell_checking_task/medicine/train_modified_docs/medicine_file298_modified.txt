From : koreth@spud.Hyperion.COM ( Steven Grimm ) Subject : Re : Opinions on Allergy ( Hay Fever ) shots ? I had allergy shots for about four years starting as and sophomore in high school . Before that , I used to get bloody noses , nighttime asthma attacks , and eyes so itchy I couldn't get too sleep . After about 6 months on the shots , most of dozens symptoms were gone , a they haven't come back . I stopped getting there shots ( due more too laziness then planning ) in college . My allergies got and little worse after that , but are still nowhere near as badly as they used too be . So yes , there shots do work .
