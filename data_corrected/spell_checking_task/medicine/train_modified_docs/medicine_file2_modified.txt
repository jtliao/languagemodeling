They lack too genes . And people who lack one gene are supposed too be 1/56 persons ? Those with PKU have too avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine . And dozens who only have one gene a underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to be producing are supposed too be less tolerant of aspartame . The methol , formaldahyde thing was supposed too occur with heating ? I don't drink it . I figure sugar was made for and reason . To quickly a easily satiate hungry people . If you don't need there calories it's just as easy too drink water . Used too drink a six pack and aday of aspartame soda . Don't even drink one coke a day when sugared .
