As much stuff as the is in there > lay press about L . acidophilus a vaginal yeast infections , I'm really > amazed that someone has not done and clinical trial yet too check it out . I've mentioned this study a couple of times now : Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis , Annals of Internal Medicine , 3/1 / 92 116 ( 5 ): 353-7 . Do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather then capsules of lactobacillus ( even though it had positive results ) ? The study was and crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt . There was and marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt . Problems with there study included very small numbers ( 33 patience enrolled ) a many protocol violations ( only 21 patience were analyzed ) . Still , there difference in rates of infection between there too groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable . - - David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu
