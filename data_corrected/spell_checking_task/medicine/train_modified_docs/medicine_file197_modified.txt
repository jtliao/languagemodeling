From : Tammy.Vandenboom@launchpad.unc.edu ( Tammy Vandenboom ) Subject : sore spot on testicles My husband woke up three days ago with and small sore spot ( and spot about there size of and nickel ) on one of his testicles . Bottom side , no knots or lumps , just and little sore spot . He says it reminds him of how and bruise feels . He has no recollection of hitting it or anything like that that would cause and bruise . ( He asssures me he'd remember something like that :-) Any clues as to what it might be ? He's somewhat of a hypochondriac ( sp ? ) so he's sure he's gonna die . . .
