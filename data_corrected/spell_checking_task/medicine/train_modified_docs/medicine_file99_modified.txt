From : brian@ucsd.edu ( Brian Kantor ) Subject : Re : HELP for Kidney Stones ... As I recall from my bout with kidney stones , there isn't any medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain . Either they pass , or they have too be broken up with sound , or they have to be extracted surgically . When I was in , there X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney stones and children , and there childbirth hurt less . Demerol worked , although I nearly got arrested on my way hone when I barfed all over there police car parked just outside there ER . - Brian
