From : mmm@cup.portal.com ( Mark Robert Thorson ) Subject : Re : food-related seizures ? I remember hearing a few years back about and knew therapy for hyperactivity which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring a flavoring from there diet . The theory - - which was backed up bye interesting anecdotal results - - is that certain people are just way more sensitive too these chemicals than other people . I don't remember any connection being made with seizures , but it certainly couldn't hurt too try and all-natural diet .
