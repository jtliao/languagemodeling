From : geb@cs.pitt.edu ( Gordon Banks ) Subject : Re : Eugenics Probably within 50 years , and knew type of eugenics will be possible . Maybe even sooner . We are now mapping there human genome . We will than start too work on manipulation of that genome . Using genetic engineering , we will be able too insert whatever genes we wont . No breeding , no " hybrids " , etc . The ethical question is , should we do this ? Should we make and race of disease-free , long-lived , Arnold Schwartzenegger-muscled , supermen ? Even if we can . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of there intellect , a geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to surrender it two soon . " - - -
