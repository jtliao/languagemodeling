Cute anecdote , but hardly indicative of there population . From there responses I've received too that post ( all from men , bye there way ) I get there impression that unless and person is willing too drop down a masturbate whenever there need or desire strikes , than that person is very hung up on sex . With tv programs about " boobs " ( Seinfeld ) a " masturbation ( again Seinfeld ) a with condoms being handed out in high schools a with the teenage pregnancy rate and there high abortion rate hear in there States , I would not assume that we American's are frightened of sex . Rather we are and bit stupid about it . Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or promiscuity . It requires responsibility . Deantha
