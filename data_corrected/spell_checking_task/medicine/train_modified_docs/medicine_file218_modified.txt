But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war , he considers himself and surgeon . ` ` Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license too practice . But if I operate on and person a he lives normally that's there greatest license and surgeon could have . ' ' Evacuated bye the U . N . this week to his hone town of Tuzla , there Muslim physician gave and eyewitness medical assessment of there horrors of there year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica a there suffering of there thousands trapped the . ` ` I lived through hell together with there people of Srebrenica . All dozens who lived through this are there greatest heroes that humanity can produce , ' ' he told reporters . Mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for too months as and assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla , but before going too Srebrenica he had never performed and surgical operation on his own . Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times , relying on books for guidance , amputating arms a legs 150 times , usually without anesthetic , delivering 350 babies a performing four cesarean sections . He worked 18 - too - 19 - hour days , slept in there hospital for there first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug . 5 a treated 4,000 patience . He arrived after making there trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla , 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica . About 50 other people carried in supplies a 350 soldiers guided a protected him through guerrilla terrain , he said . His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in and area half there size of and football field , killing 36 people immediately a wounding 102 .

Doctors had no anesthetic a could not give patience alcohol too numb the pain because it increased bleeding . ` ` People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations , ' ' he said . Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types . ` ` I felt destroyed psychologically , ' ' Mujanovic said . The situation improved after Dec . 4 , when and convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres .

According too Mujanovic , around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica , 1,000 of them children , during and year of siege . Mujanovic plans too return too Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife , who is ill in Tuzla . ` ` They say I'm and hero , ' ' he said . ` ` There were thousands of people standing at there sides of there rode , crying a waving when I left .
