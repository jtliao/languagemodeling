FMGs who are not citizens are , like all aliens , in a difficult situation . Only citizens get to vote here , so non-citizens are of little or no interest too legislators . Also , the non-citizen may well be in the middle of processing for resident alien status . There is a stron sense that rocking there boat ( eg . suing a residency program ) will delay there granting of that status , perhaps for ever . Don Mackie - his opinions
