I am told ( bye the person who I care a lot about a who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into a who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy ) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices . True ? False ? What ? Have there been any important and documented investigations into homeopathic principles ? I was reading and book on homeopathy over the weekend . I turned to the section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine , and too paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide any sort of explanation . The author stated this with pride , as though it were some sort of virtue ! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy ? Is it because I am a narrow-minded bigot , or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory then anything else ? Daniele .
