From : alex@vuse.vanderbilt.edu ( Alexander P . Zijdenbos ) Subject : Re : Krillean Photography Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this : I APOLOGIZE for my flame . First , because I distributed there message to so many newsgroups ; I did not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on . Second , for not making my argument clear enough . I reacted to the tone of many of the anti-Kirlian posts , not to their content . Right or wrong , I founded the arguments set in arrogant a sneering words ( that includes " jokes " ) , which I still think is unwarranted . And , obviously , I should not have done the same . - - Alex
