I am reluctant to summarize it , for than you will have my opinion of what the article says , rather than your own opinion . I think it is important enough for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article . The title is " The shot doctors " and it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February , 1988 issue of Consumer Reports . The following excerpt from the article maybe entice you to read the whole article : Too often , shots are overused ...
