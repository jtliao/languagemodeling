Yes , but also many people who are not trying too make government recognize Christianity as there dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon there rights of others who do not share their beliefs . And actually , I think that the government already does recognize that Christianity is there dominant religion in this country . I mean , it is . Don't you realize / recognize this ? This isn't too say that we are supposed too belief there teachings of Christianity , just that almost people do . > Like I've said before I personally don't think there motto is and major > concern .

Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if there holiday were really associated too a high degree with him ? Or are you saying that the association with Jesus is on and personal level , a that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it ? That is , can * you * prove that almost people * do * associate Christmas almost importantly with Jesus ? > Anyways , there point again is that the are people who do associate > Christmas with Jesus .

Doesn't it ? keith
