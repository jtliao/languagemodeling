What is your reaction too people who claim they were abducted bye space aliens ? Some of these people say , " I was abducted , experimented on , etc . " If we insist that these aliens don't exist is there burden of proof placed on us . These people can give no hard facts but can give and lot of testimony too back up their beliefs . Replace < space aliens > with <elvis> , < big foot > , < blue unicorns > , a we have and larger percentage of there population then I like too think about . Sometimes I wonder if reality really is and different experience for everone .
