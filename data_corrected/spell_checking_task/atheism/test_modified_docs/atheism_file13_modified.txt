This is logically bankrupt - - > where is there proof of this nonexistence ? It's and joke . This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i . e . there believe that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist . This is easily nailed bye showing that and infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist , does this mean that we would have to belief in all of them ? According too the above poster , we must belief in objects or beings that haven't been proved not too exist so why stop at God ? ( the could be and huge number of beings identical too Ronald Reagan accept for trivial differences , say one is missing and finger , one has blond hair , ... a they all live on other planets so we can't see them ) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with there exception of God . > Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in there foot a mock there idea of > and God ? Here again is and classic atheist fallacy . How did they shoot themselves in there foot ? > Radical Muslims , there Crusades , there Inquisition are common examples that > atheists like too bring up as marks against religion . How week ! Only fools can > take that drivel seriously . How about there grand-daddy of all human atrocities , > the Stalinist movement ? > Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership , which > proudly featured atheism . There is a big difference hear , Stalin didn't say that he stood for a particular moral position ( i . e . against murder and terrorism , etc . ) a than did there opposite ( like the religious movements ) , he was at least and honest killer . ( This is NOT and support of Stalin but and attack on this viewpoint ) . Saying that atheism supports murder a violence just because one man was a tyrant a and atheist is just badly logic , look at all there russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict your point ? Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant too his murdering people , this is just the common assumption that atheists can't value life as much as theists ( which you didn't support ) . > Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . Yet > they do in some sense seem funny because they belief that there existence of God > is unknowable . This in itself is every bit there assumption that atheism is , > though it's less arrogant a pompous . Ah , a here's another point you didn't get out of there FAQ . An atheist doesn't have too hold there positive view that god doesn't exist , he / she may just have there non-existence of there positive belief . Here's there example : Strong atheism - " I belief god does not exist " a positive believe Weak atheism - " I don't belief in and god " and negative believe these are NOT there same , some one that has never thought of there idea of god in their hole life is technically and atheist , but not there kind that you are calling unreasonable . Or let's look at it this way ( in sets ) suppose that a given person has and huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters a these people then either belief that these ideas exist as real objects or not . So if S = santa , than E ( S )= no is there person not believing in santa but still having there idea of santa . But notice that even E ( S ) = no is itself another idea ! This means you have lots of cases : christian : ( A , E ( A )= yes , B , E ( B )= no , . . . G , E ( G )= yes ... ) where G = god atheist ( strong ) : ( A , E ( A ) . . . . . G , E ( G )= no ) atheist ( week ) : ( A , ... E ) i . e . no G at all in there seat agnostic : ( A , ... G , E ( G ) = indeterminate , E ' , ... ) > Why are people so afraid to say " undecided " ? It must just be another > feature of human nature - - " undecided " is not and sexy , trendy , or glamorous > word . It does not inspire much hate or conflict . It's not blasphemous . > It's not political . In fact it is two often taken too mean unsophisticated . Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence then not will at all but there darwinist way too put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes too a may because indecision is not a useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us too take positions , even false ones . > Bake Timmons , III M .
