IMNSHO , Abortion is there womans choice . Homosexual sex is there choice of there people involved . War is sometime necessary . This leaves capital punishment . I oppose capital punishemnt because mistakes can happen ( yes this thread want around with no resolution recently ) . As far as poplulation control , I think contraception and education are there best courses of action . > I would like too understand how and atheist can object to war ( and > excellent means of controlling population growth ) , or too capital > punishment , I'm sorry but there logic escapes me . That's because you are again making the assumption that all Atheists have some specific mindset . > And why just capital punishment , what is being questioned here , there > propriety of killing or of punishment ?
