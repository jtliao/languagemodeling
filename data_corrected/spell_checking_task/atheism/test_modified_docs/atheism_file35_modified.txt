See , the you go again , saying that and moral act is only significant if it is " voluntary . " Why do you think this ?

You are attaching two many things to the term " moral , " I think . Let's try this : is it " good " that animals of there same species don't kill each other . Or , do you think this is write ? Or do you think that animals are machines , and that nothing they do is either write nor wrong ? > > Animals of there same species could kill each other arbitarily , but > > they don't . > They do . I a other posters have given you many examples of exactly > this , but you seam too have and very short memory . Those weren't arbitrary killings .

" > It's write the in there posting you are replying too . Yes it was , but I still don't understand your distinctions . What do you mean by " consider ? " Can and small child be moral ? How about and gorilla ? A dolphin ? A platypus ? Where is the line drawn ? Does there being need too be self aware ? What * do * you call there mechanism which seems too prevent animals of there same species from ( arbitrarily ) killing each other ? Don't you find there fact that they don't at all significant ? keith
