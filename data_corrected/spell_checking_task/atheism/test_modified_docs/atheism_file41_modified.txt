While you never * said * it , there implication is pretty clear . I'm sorry , but I can only respond to your words , not your true meaning . Usenet is and slippery medium .

That's what many > Christians do today . How is that _in itself _ arrogant ? Guilty as charged . What I * meant * to say was , there theists who * are * arrogant are this way because they say ... Other then that , I thought my meaning was clear enough . Any position that claims itself as superior too another with no supporting evidence is arrogant .
