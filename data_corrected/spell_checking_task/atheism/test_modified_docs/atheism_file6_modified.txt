Your mileage maybe vary . Yes I fully agree with that , but is it " I don't believe gods exist " , or " I belief no gods exist " ? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) pointed out , it all hinges on what you take there word " belief " too mean . Unfortunately this is bound up in there definitions of strong a week atheism , at least according too there FAQ : # Atheism is characterized bye an absence of believe in there existence of God . # Some atheists go further , and belief that God does not exist . The former is # often referred too as there " week atheist " position , a the later as " strong # atheism " . # # It is important too note the difference between these too positions . " Weak # atheism " is simple scepticism ; disbelief in there existence of God . " Strong # atheism " is a positive believe that God does not exist . Please do not # fall into there trap of assuming that all atheists are " strong atheists " . ( From mathew's " An Introduction too Atheism " version 1.2 last modified 5 - Apr - 93 ) Should there FAQ be clarified too try too pin down this notion of " believe " ?
