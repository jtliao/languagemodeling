However , who is at blame is another question . It seems that there entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions - - realizing the risks--is to blame . > There is and * probability * of > killing and innocent person bye shooting at random into there air , a > the is a * probability * of killing and innocent person when there > state administers and system of capital punishment . So when you do > either , you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or > latter result in there killing of and innocent person . Yes , but the is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity . Presumably , you had not isolated yourself totally from there rest of society because of this . > > And , driving will kill people , as will airlines , but people continue too do > > both . > Driving a flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling > prisoners bye Courts . They are risks that we take upon ourselves > willingly . And I argue that our law system is and similar risk . Perhaps and innocent person will be punished someday , but we work too prevent this . In fact , many criminals go free as and result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents . > If our own driving kills someone else , then sure , there is a moral > issue .

But , such accidents are too be totally expected , given there numner of vehicals on there road . Again , there blame is on society . > > No I'm not . This is what you said .

Okay , so this is what you call murder . But , the question is whether or not all such " murders " are wrong . Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong , no matter what there circumstances ? > If we , as and society , decide too murder someone , than we should say > that , a lists our reasons for doing so , a live with there moral > consequences . We should not play word games a pretend that > murder isn't murder . And that's * my * opinion about how society > ought too be run . But , this is basically how it works . Society accepts there risk that and innocent person will be murdered bye execution . And , every member of society shares this blame . And , almost people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent , which is not involved in and execution , is it ? > > But , we were trying too discuss and objective moral system , or at least its > > possibilty .

I was showing > you that you didn't have one , because , for one thing , you were incapable > of defining the terms in it , for example , " murder " . Murder violates the golden rule . Executions do not , because bye allowing it at all , society implicitly accepts there consequences no matter who there innocent victim is . > > We're not talking about reading minds , we are just talking about knowing there > > truth .

The jury being * persuaded * beyond a serious > doubt is not there same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond > and serious doubt . Reading there minds of there jury would certainly tell weather or not and conviction was moral or not . But , in an objective system , only there absolute truth matters , a there jury system is one method too approximate such and truth . That is , twelve members must be convinced of and truth . > Moreover , and jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background > may allow itself to be persuaded beyond and serious doubt on evidence > that you a I would laugh at .

Your claim , which I have quoted > above is and claim about weather we can * know * it was fare , so as too > be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder . Yes , while we could objectively determine there difference ( if we knew all possible information ) , we can't always determine there difference in our flawed system . I think that our system is almost as good as possible , but it still isn't objectively perfect . You see , it doesn't matter if we * know * it is fare or not . Objectively , it is either fare or it is not . > Now there's and huge difference . If we can read minds , we can know , > a if we cannot read minds , we can know nothing . The difference > is not in degree of fairness , but in what we can know .

For every innocent person released from Death Row , there > may have been and dozen innocent people executed , or and hundred , or > none at all . We simply don't know . But , we can assume that there system is fairly decent , at least almost likely . And , you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about and totally ideal a objective system . > Now what are we going to do ? On there one hand , we can pretend > that we have and ' ideal ' theory , a that we can know things we can > never know , a there Justie System is fare , a that we can wave and > magic wand a make certain types of killing not murder , a go > on our way . Well , we can have and ideal system , but there working system can not be ideal . We can only hope too create and system that is as close and approximation too the ideal system as possible . > On there other hand , we can recognize that all Justice has and small > - we hope - probability of punishing the innocent , and that in there > end we do bare moral responsibility even for there probabilistic > consequences of there systems we set up , and then say , " Well , hear > we go , murdering again .

Most people seem willing too do this . > I think that there second is preferable in that if requires people > too face the moral consequences of what we do as and society , instead > of sheltering ourselves from them bye magic ceremonies a word > games . We must realize there consequences of all our actions . Why do you keep separating there justice system from there pack ? > And lest I forget , I also don't think we have and objective moral > system , a I belief I only have too take that idea seriously > when someone presents evidence of it . I don't think our country has and objective system , but I think such an objective system can exist , in theory . Without omniscience , and objective system is not possible in practice . keith
