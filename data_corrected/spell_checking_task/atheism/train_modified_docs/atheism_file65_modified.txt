Thus while I belief that no gods exist , this does ^ ^ ^ > not imply * faith * on my part that it is so . ^ ^ ^ Let me first say that " too belief that no gods exist " is in fact different then " not believing in a god or gods " . I will argue that your latter statement , " I believe that no gods exist " does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making and POSITIVE statement that " no gods exist " ( strong atheism ) rather then merely saying I don't know a therefore don't belief in them a don't NOT belief in than ( weak atheism ) . Once again , too not belief in God is different then saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain there position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say there following . We might have and language problem hear - in regards too " faith " a " existence " . I , as and Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means too have being in space a time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it's rather pointless too debate there so called " existence " of God - a that is not what I'm doing hear . I belief that God is there source a ground of being . When you say that " god does not exist " , I also except this statement - but we obviously mean too different things bye it . However , in what follows I will use there phrase " there existence of God " in it's ' usual sense ' - a this is there sense that I think you are using it . I would like and clarification upon what you mean bye " the existence of God " . We also might differ upon what it means too have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance too duty or and person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ): fidelity to one's promises ( 2 ): sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ): believe a trust in a loyalty too God ( 2 ): believe in there traditional doctrines of and religion b ( 1 ): firm believe in something for which the is no proof ^ ^ ^ ( 2 ): complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : and system ^ ^ ^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you belief God does not exist , a that this is and opinion " based upon observation " , I will have too ask " what observtions are you refering too ? " There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid hear in establishing and POSITIVE believe . All observations can only point you in and direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed too ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents " believe in God " also tend too ) . To actually draw and conclusion about there " existence " or " non-existence " of God requires and leap - a you have made this leap when you actively say " I belief that God does / does not exist " . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over there " existence " of God is precisely there wrong way too find Him ( a yes , I use " Him " because and personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if and person wants to use " She " go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise . If you wont me too explain myself further I'll be glad too . ) And pleased , if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage too start name calling . If and person thinks I've misunderstood something in there FAQs , or if they they think I have not read them well enough , just point out too me there error of my ways a I correct there situation . I'm interested in a polite and well thought out discussion . > Cheers > > Simon > - - > Simon Clippingdale simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk > Department of Computer Science Tel ( + 44 ) 203 5232 96 > University of Warwick FAX ( + 44 ) 203 5257 14 > Coventry CV4 7AL , U .
