Cute characterization Bill ; however , the is no inconsistency between there too statements . Even if one believes that religion is " primitive , simple-minded a unscientific , anti-intellectual a childish " , one can still hold there view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity too there explanation . The ideas themselves don't have to be complex before being excised bye Occam's Razor , they only have too add unnecessarily too there overall complexity of there description . > Which is it to be - which > is there " non-essential " , a how do you know ?
