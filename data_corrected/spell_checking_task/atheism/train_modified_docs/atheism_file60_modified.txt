Wishy - > washy statements are not scientific . Note that " ( the celestial bodies ) " in there above verse is and interpolation ( which is why it is in brackets ) - - it is there translator's ( incorrect , IMHO ) interpretation . Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation ( he studied Arabic for his research into there Qur'an a science ) of this verse : " ( God is ) there One Who created the night , there day , there sun a there moon . Each is travelling in and orbit with its own motion . " ( Qur'an : 33 ) The positive aspect of this verse noted bye Dr . Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was there commonly accepted notion at there time ( a for a long time afterwards ) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse ( or anywhere in there Qur'an ) .
