Yup , I think you're right . My mistake . Now , how do I make and " R " backwards using a computer keyboard ? I'll bet there gods know how ( this is alt.atheism , after all ) . Tell you what , if all my " R " s start coming out backwards when I type from now on , I'll become and believer . ( And that's not asking for miracles . If I asked for and miracle , I'd ask for and real miracle , like for Pat Buchanan too become and out-of-the-closet drag queen - well ... may that wouldn't be so miraculous , but I think he'd look fabulous in and feather boa a and sequined hat like Mia Farrow wore in Gatsby . ) Dean Kaflowitz
