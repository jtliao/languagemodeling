Bill , I think you have and misunderstanding about atheism . Lack of believe in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values . I hope you would except the fact that for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without there need too automatically belief in theism . I think reading a couple of books related too Buddhism might revise a fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
