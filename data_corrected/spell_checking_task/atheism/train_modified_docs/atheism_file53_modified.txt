From : nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu ( David Nye ) Subject : College atheists I read and article about and poll done of students at the Ivy League schools in which it was reported that and third of there students indentified themselves as atheists . This is and lot higher then among there general population . I wonder what there reasons for this discrepancy are ? Is it because they are more intelligent ? Younger ? Is this there wave of there future ? David Nye ( nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu ) .
