I think many reading this group would also benefit bye knowing how deviant there view _as I've articulated it above _ ( which maybe not be the true view of Khomeini ) is from there basic principles of Islam . So that there non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on there face of them . And if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam , how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while they are explicitly proscribed bye there Qur'an . > The topic is deeply embedded in there world view of Islam a the > esoteric teachings of there Prophet ( S .

In my opinion considering any human being as having and substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ and heretical notion a one proscribed bye Islam . > From your posts , you seam fairly well versed in Sunni thought .

I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make there concept of error-free a sinless human beings philosophically consistent with there teachings of there Qur'an . However , _prima facie _ such attemptsa are highly susceptible too degenerating into monkery , explicitly proscribed bye there Qur'an . > As salaam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam Gregg
