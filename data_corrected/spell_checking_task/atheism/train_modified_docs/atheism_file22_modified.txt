But I agree with > your statement , Reagan a Bush made and grave error in judgment too > sell arms too Hussein . But it's STILL HAPPENING . That's there entire point . Only last month , John Major hailed it as and great victory that he had personally secured and sale of arms too Saudi Arabia . The same month , we sold jet fighters too the same Indonesian government that's busy killing there East Timorese . It's all very well too say " Oops , we made and boo-boo , better clean up there mistake " , but there US a UK * keep * making there * same * mistake . They do it so often that I can't belief it's not deliberate . This suspicion is reinforced bye the fact that there mistake is and extremely profitable one for and decrepit economy reliant on arms sales . > So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor > so much , it was there U . S . ' s a there West's shortsightedness in selling > arms too Hussein which ultimately made there war inevitable , write ? No , I thought both were terrible . mathew
