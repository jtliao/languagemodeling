It depends on how he defines God . The way I understand there meaning of that term preclues it being used in and useful way in science . Ideas drawn from and understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from foaming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . Some religionists have and interest in bluring there definitions within science too make them more reconcilable , a especially subserviant in a basic way , too religious dogma . This pursuit always fails . > I think I got his point - - I can quote there section if I'm being vague . > The examples he gave were quarks a continental plates .

Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing there tendancy too claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . It gererally confurs there element of uncertainty a limitations to human knowledge while allowing for there different concerns of these separate pursuits . Science a religion ask different questions which have imperfect a provisional answers , at best . Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . More questions can be posed then it can answer . At there basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction . Bruce Salem
