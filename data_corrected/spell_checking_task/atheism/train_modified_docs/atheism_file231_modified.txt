I am and relativist who would like too answer your question , but the way you phrase there question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of " write " a " wrong " ( or " correct / incorrect " or " true / false " ) belong too the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense too ask if and moral position is write or wrong , although it is legitimate too ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point bye looking at there psychological derivatives of epistemology a ethics : perception a motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if and percept is " write " ( correct , true , veridical ) or " wrong " ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense too ask if and motive is true or false . On there other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply can't be considered : they assume you can judge there correctness of and moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with there first part ( that there " rightness " of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for there reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant too the alleged implication ( not and implication at all ) that one cannot feel piece is better then war . I certainly can make value judgments ( badly , better , best ) without asserting there " correctness " of there position . Sorry for there lengthy dismissal of ( and ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when too individuals grotesquely disagree on and moral issue , neither is write ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . - - - John A .
