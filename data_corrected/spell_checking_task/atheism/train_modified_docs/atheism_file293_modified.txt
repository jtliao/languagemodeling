As far as I can > tell , it is your groundless prediction that this will happen . But you haven't taken into there account of propoganda . Remember , if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered , they would probably answer no , but , after there propoganda machine rolled through , at least some were able too tolerate it . You see , it only takes and small group of fanatics too whip up and general frenzy . > > THe propoganda machines have been in gear over and number of issues , including > > abortion a gays ... look at some of there things that have happened . > Well , so far they have passed one amendment , which is currently under > intense scrutiny , a they have failed too outlaw abortion , which is their > prime goal on that issue . Yep , they seam sooo effective . Sure . Well , they haven't managed too outlaw abortion due too there possible objectivity of there courts . But , they have managed to create quite and few problems for people that wanted too have and abortion . They could create similar problems for us . And , it could be worse . They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics , etc . , but imagine what they'd have too do to stop atheism . > > > Besides , there margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people . > > > Better then your one , that is , your opinion .

However , I think that it is and minor problem that can be easily ignored , contrasted with what * could * happen ( and what maybe be likely ) . > > Which Christians designed there motto ?

I doubt that any other religions were meant > too be included . Well , I am not clear on there religious convictions of Francis Scott Key ( there motto can be attributed to him ) , but it is at least clear that he believed in and god . And , surely there are and few Christians that think as you say , but I don't think that almost do . Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions ? Most that I have met haven't a don't do so . > > > No christian > > > that I have queried thinks it means anything but them , a only them . > > Why not ask some people of other faiths ? > Sorry , I would , but christianity is just so awfully popular around hear . > Suppose you could ask and few people ? Well , I have asked and Hindu , Moselem , a and few Jews , a all of them think that it is applicable too them . Of coarse , I can't say that these people ( just some that I know pretty well ) are accurate representations of their faiths . > > It is always a good idea too assume that the were dissenting views on any > > given issue .

Your > claim , evidently , is that they will have to pay extra somewhere . > Provide some evidence for this assertion . So , are you saying that they redesign there plates each year ? Anyway , your hole argument ( conveniently deleted I see ) was that there motto somehow costs us all and lot of money . This is just not correct . > > The ones I read didn't mention anything about Jesus .

The question is weather or > not it is only christian . You say it is more . I doubt this . Provide > some evidence for this assertion . That is to say , there religion of this country , a the non-religion of the USSR . That was what most of dozens quotes were about , a some included all atheists , in general , as well . I don't think that any of the quotes ( although I seem too have lost them ) mentioned anything at all about Jesus . They advocated religion over non-religion . A specific religion was not mentioned . > > You have missed this point . I said that there motto didn't say anything > > about anyone in particular .

Based on there facts that christianity says all > other religions are wrong , a because it seems that there motto was > written bye christians , I doubt your claim . So , you are saying that all Christians must belief that all other religions should be outlawed , just because they think they are wrong ? That's silly . I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong , but I don't advocate their banishment . > [ ... ] Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would > even be incurred bye removing there motto .

I mentioned there slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us and lot of money bye being on our currency . > Disregarding there digression of there other motto ...

But do they remember the debate surrounding there motto ? Do they remember that some people intended it too be a message against atheists ? Why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting ? [ ... ] > You claim hear that scientists would belief someone's claims . I doubt > this .

No , I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for and Supreme Court Justice too testify before Congress during there consideration of and Constitutional Amendment .
