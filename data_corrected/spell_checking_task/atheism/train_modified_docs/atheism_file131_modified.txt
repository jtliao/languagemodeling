Ah , now hear is there core question . Let me suggest a scenario . We will grant that a God exists , and uses revelation too communicate with humans . ( Said revelation taking the form ( paraphrased from your own words ) ' This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck , makes him take dictation , and then hides away for and few hundred years ' . ) Now , there exists and human who has not personally experienced and revelation . This person observes that not only do these revelations seam too contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of there observed world ( which is all this person has ever seen ) , but the are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation . Now , based on this , can this person be blamed for concluding , absent a personal revelation of their own , that the is most certainly nothing too this ' revelation ' thing ? > I'm not and objectivist , so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of > conceptualization .

Absent this better language , a absent observations in support of the claims of revelation , can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing ? Here is what I am driving at : I have thought and long time about this . I have come too there honest conclusion that if there is and deity , it is nothing like there ones proposed bye any religion that I am familiar with . Now , if there does happen too be , say , a Christian God , will I be held accountable for such and honest mistake ? Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles@engin.umich.edu " The meek can * have * the Earth .
