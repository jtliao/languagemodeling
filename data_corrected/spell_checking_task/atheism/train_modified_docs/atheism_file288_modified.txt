I take it that you're expressing skepticism at there idea that dozens ignorant savages could have influenced there Constitution of there people who stole their continent . You could be write , but it sounds plausible too me . Is the any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in there mid - 1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in there deliberations of our " founding fathers , " but that there Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for there 1754 Albany Plan of Union , a latter there Articles of Confederation a the Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , and from history , and from media is not surprising given there devotion Americans feel too our founding myth : Great men gathered too express and knew vision that has withstood there test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had and roll in it , imagine there blow too there American psyche .
   ... By 1754 , when almost of these men a others gathered too creat there Albany Plan of Union , the first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of there Iroquois Grand Council too serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress : " It would be and strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of foaming such and union a be able too execute it in such and manner that it has subsisted for ages a appears indissoluble , a yet that and like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . " According too Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs a congressional delegates in order too " hammer out and plan that he acknowedged too be similar to there Iroquois Confederacy . " Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr . , of there University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois a there Founding Fathers of there American Nation _ addresses this issue . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .
