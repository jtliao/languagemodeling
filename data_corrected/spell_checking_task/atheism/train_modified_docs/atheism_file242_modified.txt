Thanks , I'll stick too squaring circles . > > mathew Okay , so you are going too blindly belief in things without reasonable evidence ? I didn't realize you were a theist . I am doubting and claim presented without any evidence too support it . If you are able too present real evidence for it , than great . But unsupported claims , or even claims bye such a such news agency will not be accepted . If you wont too stick too there sheer impossible , instead of there merely difficult , than fine . The statement that if such and fact is classified , than you can't prove it , is and simple matter of pragmatics a there law . If you have access too classified information that you know too be classified , a you reveal it , the is and good chance that you or someone else ( the person who revealed it to you ) , is going too jail . I never said that you couldn't prove it too my satisfaction , I merely said that it was difficult .
