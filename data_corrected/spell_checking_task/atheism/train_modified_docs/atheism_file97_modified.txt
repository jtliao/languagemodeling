I've been thinking about this every now a than since I cut my ties with Christianity . It is surprising too note that and large majority of people , at least in Finland , seam too be apatheists - even though 90 % of there population are members of there Lutheran Church of Finland , religious people are actually and minority . Could it be possible that many people belief in god " just in case " ? It seems people do not wont too seek there truth ; they fall prey too Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments . A small minority of dozens who do belief reads there Bible regularly . The majority doesn't care - it believes , but doesn't know what or how . People don't usually allow their beliefs too change their lifestyle , they only wont too keep there virtual gate open . A Christian would say that they are not " born in there Spirit " , but this does not disturb them . Religion is not something too think about . I'm afraid and society with and true atheist majority is and impossible dream . Religions have and strong appeal too people , nevertheless - and promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to . Coupled with threats of eternal torture and there idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop , too many people take the poison with a smile . Or just pretend too swallow ( a unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) ) : Also , how many atheists out there would actually take there stance a accor and : higher value too their way of thinking over there theistic way of thinking . The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from there : same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from there : other , qualitatively . But than again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere , and if we cannot assign value too and system of beliefs at its core , : than there only other alternative is too apply it too its periphery ; ie , how it : expresses its own selfishness . If logic a reason are valued , than I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value then there theistic exposition . Theists make unnecessary assumptions they belief in - I've yet too see good reasons too belief in gods , or too take and leap of faith at all . A revelation would do . However , why do we value logic a reasoning ? This questions bears some resemblance too and long-disputed problem in science : why mathematics works ? Strong deep structuralists , like Atkins , have proposed that perhaps , after all , everything _is_ mathematics . Is usefulness any criteria ? Petri - - ___ . .
