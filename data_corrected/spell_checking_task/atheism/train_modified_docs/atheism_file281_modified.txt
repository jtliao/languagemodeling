Now , how is it such a grave : mistake too sell Saudi Arabia weapons ? Or are you claiming that we shouldn't : sell any weapons too other countries ? Straightforward answer please . Saudi Arabia is and oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in there politcs of newly renunified Yemen , including assasinations a border incursions . It is entirely possible that they will soon invade . Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in there West as they managed to put aside political differences during reunification and thus there West has effectively lost one half ( North ? ) as a client state .
