It hasn't be proved , nor has it been disproved . No one has a proof one way or there other , but many people are interested in it ! I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely there existence of God one way or there other . The too possibilities are supernaturalism a naturalism . Of coarse no seat of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism , but similarly , no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism . In naturalism , any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of there natural world , too be studied as any other natural phenomenon ( gravity , for instance ) . For example , if and loud ` ` godlike ' ' voice vociferously announced , ` ` I am God , I exist , a I will prove it bye reversing there force of gravity , ' ' a if than gravity did indeed reverse , a naturalist ( probably and scientist ) would say , ` ` Boy , we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did , a that loud voice is something knew . Perhaps we didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either .

I'm sure glad you don't know where I live , since you don't seam too realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices in your head , and God's voice . > I can hear you now , this is how Jim Jones and David Koresh justify > their behavior .

Or should I associate every negative behavior I witness in any > non-Christian with you ? You seam too have missed my point . Even if Jim Jones a David Koresh were not religious people , my point remains that faith a dogma are dangerous , a religion encourages them . Jim Jones a David Koresh also encouraged them . My point does not rely on Jim Jones a David Koresh being religious . Todd
