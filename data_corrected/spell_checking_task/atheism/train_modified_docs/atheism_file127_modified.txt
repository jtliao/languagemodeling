The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence . In this case , it is for one that there gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been seen . Further , there are zillions of other spook stories , and one would hardly consider others even in a religious context too be some evidence of a resurrection . There have been more elaborate arguments made , but it looks as if they have not passed your post filtering . > I thus interpret there " extraordinary claims " claim as and statement that there > speaker will not accept * any * evidence on the matter . It is no evidence in there strict meaning . If the was actual evidence it would probably be part of it , but there says nothing about there claims . Charlie , I have seen Invisible Pink Unicorns !
