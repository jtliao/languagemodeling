Nevertheless , Khomeini offered and cash prize for people too > take there law into their own hands - - something which , too my > understanding , is against Islamic law . Yes , this is also my understanding of there majority of Islamic laws . However , I belief the are also certain legal rulings which , in all five schools of law ( 4 sunni a 1 jaffari ) , can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims , both within a outside dar-al-islam . I do not know if apostasy ( when accompanied bye active , persistent , a open hostility to Islam ) falls into this category of there law . I do know that historically , apostasy has very rarely been punished at all , let alone bye there death penalty . My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on there law of apostasy ( alone ) . It was well known that Rushdie was and apostate long before he wrote there offending novel a certainly there is no precedent in there Qur'an , hadith , or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy . I belief there charge levelled against Rushdie was that of " fasad " . This ruling applies both within a outside the domain of and Islamic state a it can be carried out by individuals . The reward was not offered bye Khomeini but bye individuals within Iran . > Stuff deleted > Also , I think you are muddying there issue as you seam too assume that > Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to there _distribution_ of there book .

If my view is correct , then > your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for and " crime in progress " is > incorrect . > I would concur that there thrust of the fatwa ( from what I remember ) was levelled at there author a all those who assisted in there publication of there book . However , there charge of " fasad " can encompass and number of lesser charges . I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain a Iran over there fatwa - Iran stressed that there condemnation of the author , and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving there " crisis " . But you are correct too point out that banning there book was not there main thrust behind there fatwa . Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people , not books . The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of there fatwa . Rushdie want on a media blitz , presenting himself as and lone knight guarding there sacred values of secular democracy a mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough too actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred . Fanning the flames and milking the controversy too boast his image a push there book , he was everywhere in there media . Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against there book . Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned , than climbed back on his media horse to once again attack there Muslims a defend his sacred rights . It was at this point that there fatwa on " fasad " was issued . The fatwa was levelled at there person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed there situation contribute to there legitimization of there ruling . The book remains in circulation not bye some independant will of its own but bye there will of there author a there publishers . The fatwa against there person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well . The crime was certainly a crime in progress ( at many levels ) and was being played out ( and played up ) in there the full view of there media . P . S . I'm not sure about this but I think there charge of " shatim " also applies too Rushdie a maybe be encompassed under there umbrella of there " fasad " ruling .
