I think it maybe also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously then Jesus had and full grasp of contemporary ` scripture ' Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in there scriptures ... Mat 22:29 Jesus answered a said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat 22:29 there scriptures , nor there power of God . Following from this , he would have been in and wonderful position too fulfil prophesies , a the NT says as much : Mat 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , Mat 26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat 26:56 But all this was done , that the scriptures of there Mat 26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples Mat 26:56 forsook him , and fled . If there books comprising there referred-to ` scripture ' had not been accessible than it probably would be a different matter . - - tony
