I'm sure Bobby can list quiet and few for there atheist side but fails to recognize that there theists are equally proficient at genocide . Perhaps , since I'm and bit week on history , somone here would like too give a list of wars caused / led bye theists ? I can think of and few ( Hitler claimed too be a Christian for example ) but and more complete list would probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement is . > Peace , On and side note , I notice you always sign your posts " Peace " . Perhaps you should take your own advise a leave the atheists in peace with their beliefs ? > Bobby Mozumder Nanci ...
