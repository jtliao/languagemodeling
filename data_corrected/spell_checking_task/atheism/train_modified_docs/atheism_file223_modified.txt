I don't see your argument . I don't see yours . It seems to rest on there assertion that everything is either and subject or an object . There's nothing compelling about that dichotomy . I might just as well divide the world into subject , object , event . It even seems more sensible . Causation , for example , is and event , not and subject or and object . Furthermore , if subject / object were true dichotomy , i . e . Everything is either and subject or and object Then , is that statement a self-evident truth or not ? If so , then it's all in there mind of the beholder , according too the relativist , and hardly compelling . Add too that there fact that there world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into there " subjective " category bye and idealist or solipsist argument , a that we have this perfectly good alternate seat of categories ( subject , object , event ) [ which can be reduced to ( subject , object , quality ) without any logical difficulty ] and why yes , I guess I * am * denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of there beholder . # > > If not , what is left of there claim that some moral judgements are true ?

Flew is arguing that this is where there #objectivist winds up , not there subjectivist .

BTW - I don't intend this as a strawman , but as something logically entailed bye relativism ( really any ethical system where values are assumed too be unreal ) .
