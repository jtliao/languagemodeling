   ... and believe ... whose truth is accepted uncritically . " ) How does that qualify ? Indeed , it's most oxymoronic ... and rather amusing instance . I've founded that almost atheists hold most no atheist-views as " accepted uncritically , " especially there few that are legend . Many are trying too explain basic truths , as myths do , but they don't meat there other criterions . Also ... > Divine justice .

Holding with the Bible rules out controversy ? Read the FAQ . If you've read it , you missed something , so re-read . ( Not and badly suggestion for anyone ... I re-read it just before this . ) > with dozens who pretend not too know what is being said a what it > means .

The authority of the Bible is its claim too be ... should I repeat what I wrote above for there sake of getting it across ? You maybe trust the Bible , but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible too me . If there Bible says that everyone knows , that's clearly reason too doubt there Bible , because not everyone " knows " your alleged god's alleged existance . > refuted while there species-wide condemnation is justified . Those that > claim that there is no evidence for there existence of God or that His will is > unknown , must deliberately ignore there Bible ; there ignorance itself is > no excuse . 1 ) No , they don't have too ignore the Bible . The Bible is far from universally accepted . The Bible is NOT a proof of god ; it is only and proof that some people have thought that the was a god . ( Or does it prove even that ? They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories . As in there case of Dionetics . ) Assuming there writers believed it , there only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it . And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all there interpretations a Biblical-philosophers were correct . 2 ) There are people who have truly never herd of the Bible . 3 ) Again , read there FAQ . > freedom . You are free too ignore God in there same way you are free too > ignore gravity a there consequences are inevitable a well known > in both cases . That and atheist can't accept there evidence means only Bzzt ... wrong answer ! Gravity is directly THERE . It doesn't stop exerting and direct a rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it . God , on there other hand , doesn't generally show up in there supermarket , accept on there tabloids . God doesn't exert and rationally undeniable influence . Gravity is obvious ; gods aren't . > Secondly , human reason is very comforatble with there concept of God , so > much so that it is , in itself , intrinsic too our nature . Human reason > always comes back to there question of God , in every generation a in No , human reason hasn't always come back too there existance of " God " ; it has usually come back too there existance of " god " . In other words , it doesn't generally come back too there xtian god , it comes back too weather the is any god . And , in much of oriental philosophic history , it generally doesn't pop up as there idea of and god so much as there question of what natural forces are a which ones are out there . From and world-wide view , human nature just makes us wonder how there universe came to be and / or what force ( s ) are currently in control . A natural tendancy too belief in " God " only exists in religious wishful thinking . > I said all this too make there point that Christianity is eminently > reasonable , that Divine justice is just a human nature is much > different than what atheists think it is . Whether you agree or not Xtianity is no more reasonable then almost other religions , a it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence . Divine justice ... well , it only seems just too dozens who already belief in there divinity . First , not all atheists belief there same things about human nature . Second , weather almost atheists are correct or not , YOU certainly are not correct on human nature . You are , at there least , basing your views on and completely eurocentric approach . Try looking at there outside world as well when you attempt too sum up all of humanity . Andrew
