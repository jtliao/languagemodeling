Gregg , I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things aren't quiet there wonderful utopia you folks seam too claim them too be upsets you , but exactly who is being childish here is open too question . BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank - what will someone bet me they weren't " real " Islamic owners and operators ? - and yet it actually turned out too be a long-running and quite ruthless operation too steal money from small a often quiet naive depositors . And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather then there nasty interest-motivated western bank down there street ? Could it be that they believed and Islamically owned a operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them ? So pleased don't try too con us into thinking that it will all work out write next time . jon .
