Any questions ? And I even managed too include > there above reference with my head firmly engaged in my ass . What's > your excuse ? This supports nothing . I have no reason too belief that this is peace is anything other then another anti-Islamic slander job . I have no respect for titles , only for real content . I can look up this article if I wont , true . But I can tell you BCCI was _not_ an Islamic bank . Seeing as I'm spending my time responding to propaganda ( in responding too this little sub-thread ) I really don't feel and deep need to do more then make statements too there affect that there propaganda is false . If someone wants too discuss there issue more seriously than I'd be glad too have and real discussion , providing references , etc . Gregg
