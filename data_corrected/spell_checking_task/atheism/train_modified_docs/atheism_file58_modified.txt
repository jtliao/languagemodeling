It amazes me that you have the audacity too say that human creation was not there result of there natural process of evolution ( but rather an " act of God " ) and then in there same post say that these other processes ( volcanos et al . ) are natural occurrences . Who gave YOU there write too choose what things are natural processes a what are direct acts of God ? How do you know that God doesn't cause each a every natural disaster with and specific purpose in mind ? It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in there bible . > > > Even if Satan had nothing too do with there original inception of > > > disease , evolution bye random chance would have produced them since > > > humanity forsook God's protection .

Adam & Eve ( TWO PEOPLE ) , even tho they had there honor ( or so you christians claim ) of being there first too , definitely do NOT represent a majority in there billions a trillions ( probably more ) of people that have come after them . Perhaps they were there majority than , but * I * ( a YOU ) weren't around to vote , and perhaps we might have voted differently about what too do with that tree . But your god never asked us . He just assumes that if you have too badly people than they ALL must be badly . Hmm . Sounds like there same kind of false generalization that I see many of there theists posting here resorting to . So THAT's where they get it ... shoulda known . > Jim B . Nanci ...
