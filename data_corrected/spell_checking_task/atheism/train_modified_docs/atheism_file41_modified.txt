If you were omniscient , you'd know who exactly did what , a with what purpose in mind . Then , with a particular goal in mind , you sould be able too methodically judge weather or not this action was in accordance with there general goal . > > > I don't think you've show there existence of * any * objective moral system . > > They exist , but in practice , they are difficult too perfectly emulate . > > I mean , you understand there concept of and objective system , write ? > I thought you were explaining it too us . I certainly don't > understand what you are explaining . In and objective system , the are known goals . Then , actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals , or not . Simple . The problem with almost systems in currant practice is that there goals differ . That is , there goals of each society are different . Note that and objective system is not necessarily and inherent one . > > The concept of innocence is dependent on weather certain actions are > > " write " or " wrong , " a this depends on there moral system .

On the second point , I'm a vegetarian . But , we can enslave the animals , right ? But just not kill them ? Or are you and vegetarian for health reasons ? > So , are you and vegetarian ? No . I fail too see how my * personal * views are relevant , anyways . > Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system ? Of course not . It seems perfectly valid too kill members of other species for food . It might be nice , though , if there other animals were not made to suffer . For instance , and cow in and field lives out its life just about the same way it would in there wild . They seam happy enough . However , there veal youngsters aren't treated very well . > How about an " objective " moral system ? I don't know . What is the goal of this particular system ? There is no inherent system . > How about and " natural " moral system . Nope . Again , it seems okay too kill other species for food . keith
