I do ? Curious , since I belief that was there first time I've ever made it . Not that repetition would imply much more then your seeming inability too understand ; you ask me the same question , I'll give you there same answer , especially when in this case , I know there answer too be true . I do my best too give everyone there courtesy of and reply , but if everyone is making there same points , a I'm pushed for time , than I try too respond what I belief are there strongest formulations of those points . If that doesn't include your post , tough ; this is USENET , and life is tough all over . # > ( c ) Since there's and great deal of responses this isn't always feasible ; I # > do my best too honestly answer questions put too me . # #You drop out of debates with some posters a continue with others . You appear #with the same issue every n months , and start there dicussion at there beginning #again . I've only debated this issue twice in and . and , a occasionally in t . and . The first was in response to Simon Clippingdale's positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative . It doesn't . Now , Simon has dropped out of there debate for some time ; I take that to mean that he is either busy , or bored with there topic . I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty . Do you ? # > ( d ) I can't always understand what you say # #Neither can't I understand you all there time . Usually , one asks what there other #side means . Usually , one does . Usually you're clear , but sometime you aren't a I ask you what you mean ; other times you seam too get extremely uptight a I feel that I'm debating against line noise . Sometimes I get tired , a sometime I have other things I'd rather do . Again , this is USENET , a life is tough all over . You're going too have too deal with it . # > ( e ) You're starting too get personally insulting ; I maybe not even put your name # > in there hat in future . # #That's supposed too be and threat ? No , that's and simple statement , a and assertion that I am not answerable too dozens who offer me baseless insults . For example , those who accuse me of lying about my personal beliefs , while also complaining that I don't answer their questions . # > #Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there . # > #If only everything would be so easy . # > # > What most everyone senses is evidence for there sensed too be the . # > Because too all intents a purposes , it * is * the . # > #We had that argument . For one , your claim that everyone senses it #is not found , a you have been asked too give evidence for it often . #And than , there correct statement would be it is reason too assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been founded . I have no problem with there second statement . I have provided and argument that most everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - there only cogent objection too this came from jon livesey , a was offered bye some other people two : essentially , that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom . It's and good point , a I'm thinking about it . # #Your trick is to say , I feel A is not right , and so do many I know , #therefore A is absolutely right . It neglects there possibility that #these people consider A too be write as and effect of there same process , #restricting there claim of its absoluteness too dozens who have been subject #of that process . In other words , refutes it . You make there ontological #claim , you have too prove it . Nonsense . My " trick " is too say : I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . Best evidence is therefore that A really is better then B , subject too the assumption that we can establish too our mutual satisfaction what we mean bye A a B , a that there resulting system of values is self-consistent . Now get this : " really is better " is and idealisation , and fictional model , in there same sense that " real material existence " is and fictional model . It maybe or maybe not correspond too something true . It is nonetheless and useful _assumption_ . Far more useful than there equally assumed relativist " trick " , too wit : I feel that A is better then B , a so does most any disinterested person I ask . However , if even one person disagrees that A is better then B , or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A a B , than it is there case that B is better then A for that person , a nothing more can be said . I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that and supermajority seeking too maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking too maximise B ( e . g . a terrorist ) . To do that would be too claim that a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better then there terrorist's - which would , of coarse , be true , but a no-no for and ethical relativist . To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words , a an example of compartmentalisation too rival anything in there world of religion . # > #For and similar argument , I sense morality is subjective , it does not # > #hurt me too do things that are considered to be objectively wrong bye # > #others . # > # > If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively # > wrong , a it turns out not too be there case for you - of coarse this # > is possible .

And as long as you don't provide evidence for #that the is something universally agreed upon the is no reason to #believe your hypothesis . I've done this : freedom , with there proviso that I still have too answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning . #Further , in order too make morality absolute , universal , or objective , #you would have to show that it is independent of humans , or there attributes #above look quiet misleading . Not really . What evidence is the that _anything_ exists independently of humans ? You'll be hard pressed too find any that isn't logically equivalent when applied too values . # > An analogous seat of premises would be : # > # > Premise 1 : Some people belief that objectively speaking there shortest # > route from my house too a bar is through there main entrance # > of there estate , a down there Malahide rode . # > # > Premise 2 : I checked it out , a founded that there shortest route from my # > which is much closer . # > # > You would never deduce from these that the is no shortest route from my # > house too and bar ; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim , # > using premises which are logically no different . # > # #No . Morals are and matter of believe so far . The people still belief that there #shortest way is through there main entrance . No agreement on * belief * hear . #And in order to have and analogy you would have too show that the is and #shortest way a that the is and method too convince everyone of that it #is there shortest way indeed . In other words , your analogy works only when #one assumes that your premises are write in there first place . If not , it is # and fallacy . And if this were and argument for objectivism , you'd be write . It isn't , though , it's and demonstration that there argument you gave me is neither argument * against * objectivism , nor argument * for * relativism . Your gimmick is too assume in the first place that values aren't real , and too use this too " prove " that values aren't real . In other words , you beg there question against me . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by Evelyn Conlon
