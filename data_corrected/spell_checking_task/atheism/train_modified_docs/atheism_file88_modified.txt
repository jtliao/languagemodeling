One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man ' s Religions _ bye John B . Noss . It was a textbook in and class I had on comparative religion or some such thing . It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as and jumping off point for further reading . It doesn't " compare " religions directly but describes each one individually a notes and few similarities . But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based . In fact , Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages . The book is divided according to major regions of there world where there biggies began ( India , East Asia , Near East ) . There is nothing about New World religions from there Aztecs , Mayas , Incas , etc . Just there stuff people kill each other over nowadays . And and few of there older religions snuffed out along there way . If you like the old stuff , then and couple of books called " The Ancient Near East " by James B . Pritchard are pretty cool . Got there Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men . Essential reading for anyone who wishes too make up their own religion a make it sound real good .
