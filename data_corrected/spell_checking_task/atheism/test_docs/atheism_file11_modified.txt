Mike , I've seen referrences too " Creation vs Evolution " several times in a . and a I have question . Is either point of view derived from direct observation ; can either be scientific ? I wonder if the whole controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the " Truth " rather than the truth itself . Both sides seam to hold too a philosophical outcome , and I can't help wondering which came first .
