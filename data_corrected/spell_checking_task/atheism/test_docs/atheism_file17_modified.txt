I agree , I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism .. You think its there increase in pre-marital sex ... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets ... others think it's there increase in designer drugs ... others think it's a communist plot .
