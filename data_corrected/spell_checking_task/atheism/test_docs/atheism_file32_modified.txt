From : kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi ( Petri Pihko ) Subject : Re : Is Morality Constant ( was Re : Biblical Rape ) Bill Conner ( bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu ) wrote : : There are a couple of things about your post an others in this thread : that are a little confusing . An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively . This definition does not include all atheists ( see the FAQ ) . However , I ( for one ) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations . It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes , and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention , or anything spiritual , for that matter . Humans are not omnipotent , and neither is science . However , science has one advantage theology doesn't : it is self - correcting , with nature as its judge . It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing and self - consistent , simple picture of our universe . Science is no longer and bunch of separate branches , it is one . From particle physics to psychology . And no aspect of our life , or our universe , is safe from its stern a stony eye . Not even our consciousness . There is no need : for any recourse too Divnity too ascribe or explain anything . There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond dozens required by : physics , chemistry , biology , etc . ; everything is random , nothing is : determnined . Actually , determinism vs . indeterminism is a philosophical question , and science cannot say weather there whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not . I think the question does not have any meaning , as far as individual human beings go . If their apparent free will is a allusion , it does not appear to be so from their prospective . Bill , can you say _for sure _ whether you have a free will or not ? : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products . There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence , it's just a happy accident . Maybe . Who are we to tell ? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species _ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere ? This can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves . Even that machinery can be result of the same principal - only the systems that can start replicating will survive , those which don't don't make it . ( Recommended reading : t . o ) : For an atheist , no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought - about - : an event can have value . From whose prospective ? I value events and things subjectively , from my prospective . Nature does not have values , because it does not have a prospective - values arise from awareness . If I have a subjective prospective , it is easy to assume that other people also do , and if I think about what it would it be like in their position , I will eventually discover there Golden Rule . Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens , in fact , it may be a product of evolution . Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because an sense of identity is helpful , allows us to play there roles of others and make us respect others who seam to have identity , too . Bill , have you ever read Aristotle ? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea ( sp . ) for starters . : How then can an atheist judge value ? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed too God ? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned ? It : seems that , in judging the values that motivate others to action , you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what : in nature can serve that purpose ? What law of nature can you invoke too : establish your values . C . S . Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism a became Christian . The argument is severely flawed . Some values , such as the Golden Rule , can have a rational basis . Some others , like the basic idea of wanting to live , has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired . Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour , and morality as well . Indeed , as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools , they also became better at killing each other . It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who new how to use tools , but not against one's own people . The Bible reveals quiet nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this . A simple set of rules to hold the people together , under one god . Their god did not care much about people of other nations . At the time of the NT , things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of a _empire_ , and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles . A knew situation required a new morality , and along with it a new religion was born . ( A mutation in a meme pool . ) : Since every event is entirely a exclusively a physical event , what : difference could it possibly make what - anyone - does , religious or : otherwise , the can be no - meaning - or gradation of value . The only : way an atheist can object to - any - behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he ( she ) just doesn't like it : - that's it . Any value judgement must be prefaced bye there disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any " absolute " sense . It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy . Whenever there is a observer , there is a subjective point of view , which may value its existence a happiness ( even if that were just a result of some physical event ) , and other's happiness , two , if the observer comes to think about it . In and absolutely objective sense , that is , without any observers or subjects , moral judgments loose their meaning . It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view . This includes gods , two , their values are only _their_ personal judgments , not absolute truths , since such truths do not exist . The fact that most people do not deliberately wont too hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence bye becoming social beings who can think a value others ' existence . Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps , dolphins and many other species show great care for each other . Dolphins have sometime saved humans from drowning , and good deed indeed . : That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God's commands , it says only that the was a electrical event in your : nervous system that created and emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . That your : objections - seam - well found is due to the way you've been : conditioned ; there is no " truth " content . The whole of your : intellectual landscape is a allusion , and virtual reality . The last statement does not logically follow . In fact , there is every reason to belief our thoughts can model reality very well , and our senses can convey reliable information . Solipsism is still a logical possibility , but not a very likely one . You are continuously mixing two different views : the subjective point of view ( which we all share ) and an objective point of view , _which does not exist _ . Any observer or thinker , any personal being , has its own point of view . It does not matter weather this point of view is a result of some physical events or not , it does not cease to be subjective . From and non-observers non-point of view , values do not exist . Neither does pain , or pleasure , or beauty , or love . Such things are inherently subjective . Once again , if god wants wives too submit to their husbands , or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown , or wants to punish us if we don't , I disagree with his morals . I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie , and machine without a single thought . If god gave us morality to judge , but I disagree with him , it is not my fault . He is free to replace my morals . I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and than to get mad at this . God must be schizophrenic . : All of this being so , you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , : etc . a cannot participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever . Neither can the opinion of any god , for that matter . I cannot understand why an subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible then an opinion of a thing made of something else . Bill , take note : Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being , _including_ gods . If god has a subjective viewpoint , it is his own point of view , and his morals are his own .
